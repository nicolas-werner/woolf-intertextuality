Analyze the following passages for potential intertextual references:

Mrs Dalloway passage:
{{dalloway_text}}

The Odyssey passage:
{{odyssey_text}}
Semantic Similarity Score: {{similarity_score}}

Follow these steps in your analysis:

1. Initial Observation:
- Note semantic similarities in themes, motifs, or narrative patterns
- Consider how similar meanings are expressed in different ways
- Identify shared concepts or ideas, even if expressed differently

2. Contextual Analysis:
- Examine how each passage functions within its larger narrative
- Consider the thematic role of each passage
- Analyze how similar meanings serve different purposes in each text

3. Literary Techniques:
- Identify how each author conveys similar meanings through different techniques
- Compare modernist vs. classical narrative approaches
- Note how Woolf might transform Homeric techniques

4. Thematic Resonance:
- Analyze how similar themes are treated differently
- Consider how Woolf might be reinterpreting Homeric themes
- Examine how gender and social perspectives influence similar themes

5. Critical Evaluation:
- Consider whether semantic similarities suggest intentional reference
- Evaluate if similarities reflect broader literary/cultural patterns
- Assess whether the similarity score reflects meaningful connections

6. Synthesis:
- Determine if this represents meaningful intertextual dialogue
- Consider how Woolf's modernist perspective transforms classical themes
- Evaluate the significance of any semantic parallels

Remember:
- High semantic similarity doesn't always indicate intentional reference
- Consider how similar meanings can serve different narrative purposes
- Pay attention to how Woolf might transform classical themes
- Consider both explicit and implicit semantic connections
- The similarity score provides context but isn't definitive
