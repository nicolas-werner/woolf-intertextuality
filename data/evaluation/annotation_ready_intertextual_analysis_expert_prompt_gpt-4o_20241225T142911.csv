cried to Mrs. Filmer in the kitchen. ""Evans, Evans,"" he had said
as she brought in the tray. She jumped, she did. She scuttled
downstairs. And Rezia came in, with her flowers, and walked across the room,
and put the roses in a vase, upon which the sun struck directly,
and it went laughing, leaping round the room. She had had to buy the roses, Rezia said, from a poor man in the
street. But they were almost dead already, she said, arranging the
roses. So there was a man outside; Evans presumably; and the roses, which
Rezia said were half dead, had been picked by him in the fields of
Greece."," But when the fair lady
had now come to the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the well-builded
roof, holding her glistening tire before her face, and on either side
of her stood a faithful handmaid. And straightway the knees of the
wooers were loosened, and their hearts were enchanted with love, and
each one uttered a prayer that he might be her bed-fellow. But she
spake to Telemachus, her dear son: “Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer stable as they
were. While thou wast still a child, thou hadst a yet quicker and more
crafty wit, but now that thou art great of growth, and art come to the
measure of manhood, and a stranger looking to thy stature and thy
beauty might say that thou must be some rich man’s son, thy mind and
thy thoughts are no longer right as of old. For lo, what manner of deed
has been done in these halls, in that thou hast suffered thy guest to
be thus shamefully dealt with. How would it be now, if the stranger
sitting thus in our house, were to come to some harm all through this
evil handling? Shame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mother mine, as to this matter I
count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have I knowledge and
understanding of each thing, of the good and of the evil; but
heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I cannot devise all things according
to wisdom, for these men in their evil counsel drive me from my wits,
on this side and on that, and there is none to aid me. Howsoever this
battle between Irus and the stranger did not fall out as the wooers
would have had it, but the stranger proved the better man.",0.7138956665473469,similar,outsider presence;flowers;women's influence - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both involve themes of perception, identity, and the presence of an outsider or stranger, which are central to the narrative dynamics of both texts.","Woolf's passage subtly integrates Homeric themes of identity, perception, and the influence of women, transforming them to fit the modernist and feminist context of *Mrs. Dalloway*.

oxhide. Even so I declare to thee this token, and I know not, lady, if
the bedstead be yet fast in his place, or if some man has cut away the
stem of the olive tree, and set the bedstead otherwhere.” So he spake, and at once her knees were loosened, and her heart melted
within her, as she knew the sure tokens that Odysseus showed her. Then
she fell a weeping, and ran straight toward him and cast her hands
about his neck, and kissed his head and spake, saying: “Be not angry with me, Odysseus, for thou wert ever at other times the
wisest of men. It is the gods that gave us sorrow, the gods who
begrudged us that we should abide together and have joy of our youth,
and come to the threshold of old age. So now be not wroth with me
hereat nor full of indignation, because at the first, when I saw thee,
I did not welcome thee straightway. For always my heart within my
breast shuddered, for fear lest some man should come and deceive me
with his words, for many they be that devise gainful schemes and evil.
Nay even Argive Helen, daughter of Zeus, would not have lain with a
stranger, and taken him for a lover, had she known that the warlike
sons of the Achaeans would bring her home again to her own dear
country. Howsoever, it was the god that set her upon this shameful
deed; nor ever, ere that, did she lay up in her heart the thought of
this folly, a bitter folly, whence on us too first came sorrow. But now
that thou hast told all the sure tokens of our bed, which never was
seen by mortal man, save by thee and me and one maiden only, the
daughter of Actor, that my father gave me ere yet I had come hither,
she who kept the doors of our strong bridal chamber, even now dost thou
bend my soul, all ungentle as it is.",0.7050723769941971,dissimilar,roses;memory;recognition - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both involve themes of memory, recognition, and the presence of absent figures, which suggest potential intertextual connections.","Woolf subtly integrates Homeric themes of memory and recognition into *Mrs. Dalloway*, transforming them to explore modernist concerns with identity and loss, while also offering a feminist critique of traditional narratives."
