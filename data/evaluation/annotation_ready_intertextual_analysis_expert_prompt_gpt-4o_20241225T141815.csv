beginning to compare her to poplar trees, early dawn, hyacinths,
fawns, running water, and garden lilies; and it made her life a
burden to her, for she so much preferred being left alone to do
what she liked in the country, but they would compare her to
lilies, and she had to go to parties, and London was so dreary
compared with being alone in the country with her father and the
dogs. Buses swooped, settled, were off--garish caravans, glistening with
red and yellow varnish. But which should she get on to? She had
no preferences. Of course, she would not push her way. She
inclined to be passive. It was expression she needed, but her eyes
were fine, Chinese, oriental, and, as her mother said, with such
nice shoulders and holding herself so straight, she was always
charming to look at; and lately, in the evening especially, when
she was interested, for she never seemed excited, she looked almost
beautiful, very stately, very serene. What could she be thinking?
Every man fell in love with her, and she was really awfully bored.
For it was beginning. Her mother could see that--the compliments
were beginning."," And as he thought within himself, it
seemed better to stand apart, and beseech her with smooth words, lest
the maiden should be angered with him if he touched her knees: so
straightway he spake a sweet and cunning word: “I supplicate thee, O queen, whether thou art a goddess or a mortal! If
indeed thou art a goddess of them that keep the wide heaven; to
Artemis, then, the daughter of great Zeus, I mainly liken thee, for
beauty and stature and shapeliness. But if thou art one of the
daughters of men who dwell on earth, thrice blessed are thy father and
thy lady mother, and thrice blessed thy brethren. Surely their souls
ever glow with gladness for thy sake, each time they see thee entering
the dance, so fair a flower of maidens. But he is of heart the most
blessed beyond all other who shall prevail with gifts of wooing, and
lead thee to his home. Never have mine eyes beheld such an one among
mortals, neither man nor woman; great awe comes upon me as I look on
thee. Yet in Delos once I saw as goodly a thing: a young sapling of a
palm tree springing by the altar of Apollo. For thither too I went, and
much people with me, on that path where my sore troubles were to be.
Yea, and when I looked thereupon, long time I marvelled in spirit,—for
never grew there yet so goodly a shoot from ground,—even in such wise
as I wonder at thee, lady, and am astonied and do greatly fear to touch
thy knees, though grievous sorrow is upon me. Yesterday, on the
twentieth day, I escaped from the wine-dark deep, but all that time
continually the wave bare me, and the vehement winds drave, from the
isle Ogygia. And now some god has cast me on this shore, that here too,
methinks, some evil may betide me; for I trow not that trouble will
cease; the gods ere that time will yet bring many a thing to pass.",0.7400507258483419,similar,natural imagery;admiration;passivity - thematic,"Both passages explore themes of beauty, admiration, and the burdens that come with being perceived as an object of desire. The descriptions of the female figures in both texts evoke natural imagery and a sense of passivity in the face of external expectations.","Woolf's passage in *Mrs. Dalloway* subtly integrates Homeric elements by transforming the admiration of beauty into a critique of societal expectations, reflecting a feminist reinterpretation of classical themes."

plenteous store, bread and sweet wine, and she clad me in imperishable
raiment, and sent forth a warm and gentle wind to blow. For ten days
and seven I sailed, traversing the deep, and on the eighteenth day the
shadowy hills of your land showed in sight, and my heart was
glad,—wretched that I was—for surely I was still to be the mate of much
sorrow. For Poseidon, shaker of the earth, stirred up the same, who
roused against me the winds and stopped my way, and made a wondrous sea
to swell, nor did the wave suffer me to be borne upon my raft, as I
made ceaseless moan. Thus the storm winds shattered the raft, but as
for me I cleft my way through the gulf yonder, till the wind bare and
the water brought me nigh your coast. Then as I strove to land upon the
shore, the wave had overwhelmed me, dashing me against the great rocks
and a desolate place, but at length I gave way and swam back, till I
came to the river, where the place seemed best in mine eyes, smooth of
rocks, and withal there was a shelter from the wind. And as I came out
I sank down, gathering to me my spirit, and immortal night came on.
Then I gat me forth and away from the heaven-fed river, and laid me to
sleep in the bushes and strewed leaves about me, and the god shed over
me infinite sleep. There among the leaves I slept, stricken at heart,
all the night long, even till the morning and mid-day. And the sun sank
when sweet sleep let me free. And I was aware of the company of thy
daughter disporting them upon the sand, and there was she in the midst
of them like unto the goddesses.",0.7183443549375654,dissimilar,nature comparisons;societal expectations;passivity - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both explore themes of isolation, societal expectations, and the natural world, suggesting potential intertextual connections.","Woolf subtly integrates Homeric elements into her narrative, transforming the epic's themes of journey and struggle into a modernist exploration of identity and societal roles, particularly through a feminist lens."
