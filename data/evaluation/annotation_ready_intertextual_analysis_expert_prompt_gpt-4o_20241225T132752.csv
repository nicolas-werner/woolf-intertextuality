now, curving up and up, straight up, like something mounting in
ecstasy, in pure delight, out from behind poured white smoke
looping, writing a T, an O, an F. ""What are they looking at?"" said Clarissa Dalloway to the maid who
opened her door. The hall of the house was cool as a vault. Mrs. Dalloway raised
her hand to her eyes, and, as the maid shut the door to, and she
heard the swish of Lucy's skirts, she felt like a nun who has left
the world and feels fold round her the familiar veils and the
response to old devotions. The cook whistled in the kitchen. She
heard the click of the typewriter."," If the lordly wooers shall slay me by
guile in the halls, and divide among them the heritage of my father,
then I should wish thee to keep and enjoy the gifts thyself, rather
than any of these. But if I shall sow the seeds of death and fate for
the wooers, then gladly bring me to the house the gifts that I will
gladly take.” Therewith he led the travel-worn stranger to the house. Now when they
came to the fair-lying palace, they laid aside their mantles on the
chairs and high seats, and went to the polished baths, and bathed them.
So when the maidens had bathed them and anointed them with olive oil,
and cast about them thick mantles and doublets, they came forth from
the baths, and sat upon the seats. Then the handmaid bare water for the
hands in a goodly golden ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin
to wash withal, and drew to their side a polished table. And the grave
dame bare wheaten bread, and set it by them, and laid on the board many
dainties, giving freely of such things as she had by her. And the
mother of Telemachus sat over against him by the pillar of the hall,
leaning against a chair, and spinning the slender threads from the
yarn. And they stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer set
before them. Now when they had put from them the desire of meat and
drink, the wise Penelope first spake among them: “Telemachus, verily I will go up to my upper chamber, and lay me in my
bed, the place of my groanings, that is ever watered by my tears, since
the day that Odysseus departed with the sons of Atreus for Ilios.",0.7179103284433777,similar,domestic setting;introspection;female perspective - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both involve domestic settings and evoke themes of anticipation and introspection.

array you in your doublets, and bid the maidens in the chambers to take
to them their garments. Then let the divine minstrel, with his loud
lyre in hand, lead off for us the measure of the mirthful dance. So
shall any man that hears the sound from without, whether a wayfarer or
one of those that dwell around, say that it is a wedding feast. And
thus the slaughter of the wooers shall not be noised abroad through the
town before we go forth to our well-wooded farm-land. Thereafter shall
we consider what gainful counsel the Olympian may vouchsafe us.” So he spake, and they gave good ear and hearkened to him. So first they
went to the bath, and arrayed them in doublets, and the women were
apparelled, and the divine minstrel took the hollow harp, and aroused
in them the desire of sweet song and of the happy dance. Then the great
hall rang round them with the sound of the feet of dancing men and of
fair-girdled women. And whoso heard it from without would say: “Surely some one has wedded the queen of many wooers. Hard of heart was
she, nor had she courage to keep the great house of her wedded lord
continually till his coming.",0.7170606940671018,similar,domestic space;sound and silence;women's roles - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both involve scenes of domesticity and social rituals, with a focus on sound and silence, and the presence of women in these spaces.","Woolf subtly integrates Homeric elements into *Mrs. Dalloway* by transforming the epic's themes of domesticity and social rituals into a modernist context, focusing on the internal experiences of women and the interplay of sound and silence."

vineyard planted, whereof the one part is being dried by the heat, a
sunny plot on level ground, while other grapes men are gathering, and
yet others they are treading in the wine-press. In the foremost row are
unripe grapes that cast the blossom, and others there be that are
growing black to vintaging. There too, skirting the furthest line, are
all manner of garden beds, planted trimly, that are perpetually fresh,
and therein are two fountains of water, whereof one scatters his
streams all about the garden, and the other runs over against it
beneath the threshold of the courtyard, and issues by the lofty house,
and thence did the townsfolk draw water. These were the splendid gifts
of the gods in the palace of Alcinous. There the steadfast goodly Odysseus stood and gazed. But when he had
gazed at all and wondered, he passed quickly over the threshold within
the house. And he found the captains and the counsellors of the
Phaeacians pouring forth wine to the keen-sighted god, the slayer of
Argos; for to him they poured the last cup when they were minded to
take rest. Now the steadfast goodly Odysseus went through the hall,
clad in a thick mist, which Athene shed around him, till he came to
Arete and the king Alcinous. And Odysseus cast his hands about the
knees of Arete, and then it was that the wondrous mist melted from off
him, and a silence fell on them that were within the house at the sight
of him, and they marvelled as they beheld him. Then Odysseus began his
prayer: “Arete, daughter of god-like Rhexenor, after many toils am I come to
thy husband and to thy knees and to these guests, and may the gods
vouchsafe them a happy life, and may each one leave to his children
after him his substance in his halls and whatever dues of honour the
people have rendered unto him.",0.7027143274882359,dissimilar,stillness;observation;smoke;mist - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both involve moments of stillness and contemplation, with characters observing their surroundings and reflecting on their place within them.","Woolf's passage subtly integrates Homeric elements by transforming the epic's themes of journey and discovery into a modernist exploration of domestic and psychological spaces.

me a mantle and a doublet for raiment, and the nymph clad herself in a
great shining robe, light of woof and gracious, and about her waist she
cast a fair golden girdle, and put a veil upon her head. But I passed
through the halls and roused my men with smooth words, standing by each
one in turn: “‘Sleep ye now no more nor breathe sweet slumber; but let us go on our
way, for surely she hath shown me all, the lady Circe.’ “So spake I, and their lordly soul consented thereto. Yet even thence I
led not my company safe away. There was one, Elpenor, the youngest of
us all, not very valiant in war neither steadfast in mind. He was lying
apart from the rest of my men on the housetop of Circe’s sacred
dwelling, very fain of the cool air, as one heavy with wine. Now when
he heard the noise of the voices and of the feet of my fellows as they
moved to and fro, he leaped up of a sudden and minded him not to
descend again by the way of the tall ladder, but fell right down from
the roof, and his neck was broken from the bones of the spine, and his
spirit went down to the house of Hades. “Then I spake among my men as they went on their way, saying: ‘Ye deem
now, I see, that ye are going to your own dear country; but Circe hath
showed us another way, even to the dwelling of Hades and of dread
Persephone, to seek to the spirit of Theban Teiresias.’ “Even so I spake, but their heart within them was broken, and they sat
them down even where they were, and made lament and tore their hair.",0.703076226666331,dissimilar,aeroplane writing;Clarissa's introspection;journey motif - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both explore themes of transition and transformation, with Woolf's text subtly echoing Homeric motifs of journey and revelation.","Woolf's passage in *Mrs. Dalloway* subtly integrates Homeric motifs of journey and transformation, reimagining them through a modernist and feminist lens.
