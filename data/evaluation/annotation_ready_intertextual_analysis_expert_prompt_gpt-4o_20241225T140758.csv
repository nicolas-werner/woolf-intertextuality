spoken so moderately yet firmly, with the air of a disciplinarian
well within his rights which are founded upon justice, neither
young Charles Morris, nor old Charles, neither Miss Elaine nor Mrs.
Morris knew. But when he said, ""Bartlett pears,"" sitting alone at
his table, they felt that he counted on their support in some
lawful demand; was champion of a cause which immediately became
their own, so that their eyes met his eyes sympathetically, and
when they all reached the smoking-room simultaneously, a little
talk between them became inevitable. It was not very profound--only to the effect that London was
crowded; had changed in thirty years; that Mr. Morris preferred
Liverpool; that Mrs. Morris had been to the Westminster flower-
show, and that they had all seen the Prince of Wales. Yet, thought
Peter Walsh, no family in the world can compare with the Morrises;
none whatever; and their relations to each other are perfect, and
they don't care a hang for the upper classes, and they like what
they like, and Elaine is training for the family business, and the
boy has won a scholarship at Leeds, and the old lady (who is about
his own age) has three more children at home; and they have two
motor cars, but Mr. Morris still mends the boots on Sunday: it is
superb, it is absolutely superb, thought Peter Walsh, swaying a
little backwards and forwards with his liqueur glass in his hand
among the hairy red chairs and ash-trays, feeling very well pleased
with himself, for the Morrises liked him. Yes, they liked a man
who said, ""Bartlett pears."," But when the fair lady
had now come to the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the well-builded
roof, holding her glistening tire before her face, and on either side
of her stood a faithful handmaid. And straightway the knees of the
wooers were loosened, and their hearts were enchanted with love, and
each one uttered a prayer that he might be her bed-fellow. But she
spake to Telemachus, her dear son: “Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer stable as they
were. While thou wast still a child, thou hadst a yet quicker and more
crafty wit, but now that thou art great of growth, and art come to the
measure of manhood, and a stranger looking to thy stature and thy
beauty might say that thou must be some rich man’s son, thy mind and
thy thoughts are no longer right as of old. For lo, what manner of deed
has been done in these halls, in that thou hast suffered thy guest to
be thus shamefully dealt with. How would it be now, if the stranger
sitting thus in our house, were to come to some harm all through this
evil handling? Shame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mother mine, as to this matter I
count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have I knowledge and
understanding of each thing, of the good and of the evil; but
heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I cannot devise all things according
to wisdom, for these men in their evil counsel drive me from my wits,
on this side and on that, and there is none to aid me. Howsoever this
battle between Irus and the stranger did not fall out as the wooers
would have had it, but the stranger proved the better man.",0.7233242267177372,similar,social dynamics;influence;group interaction - thematic,The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both explore themes of social interaction and the dynamics of power and influence within a group setting.,"Woolf's passage subtly echoes the social dynamics and power structures found in *The Odyssey*, transforming them into a modernist exploration of social influence and cohesion, with a feminist lens that highlights the nuanced power of social interaction."

marvellously, nor was he like to any man that lives by bread, but like
a wooded peak of the towering hills, which stands out apart and alone
from others. “Then I commanded the rest of my well-loved company to tarry there by
the ship, and to guard the ship, but I chose out twelve men, the best
of my company, and sallied forth. Now I had with me a goat-skin of the
dark wine and sweet which Maron, son of Euanthes, had given me, the
priest of Apollo, the god that watched over Ismarus. And he gave it,
for that we had protected him with his wife and child reverently; for
he dwelt in a thick grove of Phoebus Apollo. And he made me splendid
gifts; he gave me seven talents of gold well wrought, and he gave me a
mixing bowl of pure silver, and furthermore wine which he drew off in
twelve jars in all, sweet wine unmingled, a draught divine; nor did any
of his servants or of his handmaids in the house know thereof, but
himself and his dear wife and one housedame only. And as often as they
drank that red wine honey sweet, he would fill one cup and pour it into
twenty measures of water, and a marvellous sweet smell went up from the
mixing bowl: then truly it was no pleasure to refrain. “With this wine I filled a great skin, and bare it with me, and corn
too I put in a wallet, for my lordly spirit straightway had a boding
that a man would come to me, a strange man, clothed in mighty strength,
one that knew not judgment and justice. “Soon we came to the cave, but we found him not within; he was
shepherding his fat flocks in the pastures. So we went into the cave,
and gazed on all that was therein. The baskets were well laden with
cheeses, and the folds were thronged with lambs and kids; each kind was
penned by itself, the firstlings apart, and the summer lambs apart,
apart too the younglings of the flock.",0.7226262260061251,similar,Bartlett pears;wine;social interaction - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both involve social interactions and the sharing of food and drink, suggesting potential thematic intersections.","Woolf subtly integrates Homeric themes of hospitality and social bonding into her modernist narrative, transforming epic motifs into everyday interactions that reflect her feminist and social critiques."

long back of the white-tusked boar, and the soul of his lord rejoiced
at this renown, and Odysseus of many counsels hailed him saying: “Eumaeus, oh that thou mayest so surely be dear to father Zeus, as thou
art to me, seeing that thou honourest me with a good portion, such an
one as I am!” Then didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: “Eat, luckless stranger, and make merry with such fare as is here. And
one thing the god will give and another withhold, even as he will, for
with him all things are possible.” So he spake, and made burnt offering of the hallowed parts to the
everlasting gods, and poured the dark wine for a drink offering, and
set the cup in the hands of Odysseus, the waster of cities, and sat
down by his own mess. And Mesaulius bare them wheaten bread, a thrall
that the swineherd had gotten all alone, while his lord was away,
without the knowledge of his mistress and the old Laertes: yea he had
bought him of the Taphians with his own substance. So they stretched
forth their hands upon the good cheer spread before them. Now after
they had put from them the desire of meat and drink, Mesaulius cleared
away the bread, and they, now that they had eaten enough of bread and
flesh, were moved to go to rest. Now it was so that night came on foul with a blind moon, and Zeus
rained the whole night through, and still the great West Wind, the
rainy wind, was blowing. Then Odysseus spake among them that he might
make trial of the swineherd, and see whether he would take off his own
mantle and give it to him or bid one of his company strip, since he
cared for him so greatly: “Listen now, Eumaeus, and all of you his companions, with a prayer will
I utter my word; so bids me witless wine, which drives even the wisest
to sing and to laugh softly, and rouses him to dance, yea and makes him
to speak out a word which were better unspoken. Howbeit, now that I
have broken into speech, I will not hide aught. Oh that I were young,
and my might were steadfast, as in the day when we arrayed our ambush
and led it beneath Troy town! And Odysseus, and Menelaus son of Atreus,
were leaders and with them I was a third in command; for so they bade
me.",0.7102065412206433,dissimilar,communal meal;social interaction;recognition - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both involve social gatherings and the sharing of food, which serve as a backdrop for character interactions and reflections.","Woolf subtly integrates Homeric elements into *Mrs. Dalloway* by transforming the epic's themes of honor and social recognition into a modernist exploration of identity and social dynamics, using the motif of a communal meal as a point of intersection."

spirits of these twain were angered, and they made the wooers sit down
together and cease from their games. And among them spake Antinous, son
of Eupeithes, in displeasure; and his black heart was wholly filled
with rage, and his eyes were like flaming fire: “Out on him, a proud deed hath Telemachus accomplished with a high
hand, even this journey, and we thought that he would never bring it to
pass! This lad hath clean gone without more ado, in spite of us all;
his ship he hath let haul to the sea, and chosen the noblest in the
township. He will begin to be our bane even more than heretofore; but
may Zeus destroy his might, not ours, ere he reach the measure of
manhood! But come, give me a swift ship and twenty men, that I may lie
in watch and wait even for him on his way home, in the strait between
Ithaca and rugged Samos, that so he may have a woeful end of his
cruising in quest of his father.” So spake he, and they all assented thereto, and bade him to the work.
And thereupon they arose and went to the house of Odysseus. Now it was no long time before Penelope heard of the counsel that the
wooers had devised in the deep of their heart. For the henchman Medon
told her thereof, who stood without the court and heard their purposes,
while they were weaving their plot within. So he went on his way
through the halls to bring the news to Penelope; and as he stept down
over the threshold, Penelope spake unto him: “Henchman, wherefore have the noble wooers sent thee forth? Was it to
tell the handmaids of divine Odysseus to cease from their work, and
prepare a banquet for them? Nay, after thus much wooing, never again
may they come together, but here this day sup for their last and latest
time; all ye who assemble so often, and waste much livelihood, the
wealth of wise Telemachus! Long ago when ye were children, ye marked
not your fathers’ telling, what manner of man was Odysseus among them,
one that wrought no iniquity toward any man, nor spake aught
unrighteous in the township, as is the wont of divine kings. One man a
king is like to hate, another he might chance to love. But never did he
do aught at all presumptuously to any man.",0.7106136765951133,dissimilar,social dynamics;individual agency - thematic,The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both explore themes of social dynamics and the influence of individual actions within a community.,"Woolf's passage reflects a modernist reinterpretation of Homeric themes, focusing on the subtleties of social interaction and personal agency within a community, akin to the social maneuvering seen in *The Odyssey*."
