the strong Megapenthes bare the shining silver bowl and set it before
him. And Helen came up, beautiful Helen, with the robe in her hands,
and spake and hailed him: “Lo! I too give thee this gift, dear child, a memorial of the hands of
Helen, against the day of thy desire, even of thy bridal, for thy bride
to wear it. But meanwhile let it lie by thy dear mother in her chamber.
And may joy go with thee to thy well-builded house, and thine own
country.” With that she put it into his hands, and he took it and was glad. And
the hero Peisistratus took the gifts and laid them in the chest of the
car, and gazed on all and wondered. Then Menelaus of the fair hair led
them to the house. Then they twain sat them down on chairs and high
seats, and a handmaid bare water for the hands in a goodly golden ewer,
and poured it forth over a silver basin to wash withal, and drew to
their side a polished table. And a grave dame bare wheaten bread and
set it by them, and laid on the board many dainties, giving freely of
such things as she had by her.",0.6747275811928217,similar,hat;gift;pride;hospitality - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both involve the act of giving and receiving objects, which can symbolize deeper themes of connection, memory, and identity.","Woolf's passage subtly echoes the Homeric theme of gift-giving and hospitality, transforming it into a modernist exploration of personal identity and satisfaction. The act of twirling the hat becomes a symbol of creative pride, paralleling the ceremonial exchange of gifts in *The Odyssey*."

round the belly of the cauldron, and the water waxed hot. Meanwhile
Arete brought forth for her guest the beautiful coffer from the
treasure chamber, and bestowed fair gifts therein, raiment and gold,
which the Phaeacians gave him. And with her own hands she placed
therein a robe and goodly doublet, and uttering her voice spake to him
winged words: “Do thou now look to the lid, and quickly tie the knot, lest any man
spoil thy goods by the way, when presently thou fallest on sweet sleep
travelling in thy black ship.” Now when the steadfast goodly Odysseus heard this saying, forthwith he
fixed on the lid, and quickly tied the curious knot, which the lady
Circe on a time had taught him. Then straightway the housewife bade him
go to the bath and bathe him; and he saw the warm water and was glad,
for he was not wont to be so cared for, from the day that he left the
house of fair-tressed Calypso, but all that while he had comfort
continually as a god. Now after the maids had bathed him and anointed him with olive oil, and
had cast a fair mantle and a doublet upon him, he stept forth from the
bath, and went to be with the chiefs at their wine. And Nausicaa,
dowered with beauty by the gods, stood by the pillar of the
well-builded roof, and marvelled at Odysseus, beholding him before her
eyes, and she uttered her voice and spake to him winged words: “Farewell, stranger, and even in thine own country bethink thee of me
upon a time, for that to me first thou owest the ransom of life.” And Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: “Nausicaa, daughter
of great-hearted Alcinous, yea, may Zeus, the thunderer, the lord of
Here, grant me to reach my home and see the day of my returning; so
would I, even there, do thee worship as to a god, all my days for
evermore, for thou, lady, hast given me my life.” He spake and sat him in the high seat by king Alcinous. And now they
were serving out the portions and mixing the wine.",0.6693769992140179,similar,domesticity;preparation;hospitality - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both involve domestic settings and the act of giving or preparing something, which could suggest a thematic intersection.","Woolf's passage can be seen as a modernist reinterpretation of the themes of domesticity and preparation found in *The Odyssey*, transforming them into moments of personal creativity and pride, rather than traditional hospitality."

thee, how wise soever, to observe the purposes of the everlasting gods.
None the less let us go to my child, that I may see the wooers dead,
and him that slew them.” With that word she went down from the upper chamber, and much her heart
debated, whether she should stand apart, and question her dear lord or
draw nigh, and clasp and kiss his head and hands. But when she had come
within and had crossed the threshold of stone, she sat down over
against Odysseus, in the light of the fire, by the further wall. Now he
was sitting by the tall pillar, looking down and waiting to know if
perchance his noble wife would speak to him, when her eyes beheld him.
But she sat long in silence, and amazement came upon her soul, and now
she would look upon him steadfastly with her eyes, and now again she
knew him not, for that he was clad in vile raiment. And Telemachus
rebuked her, and spake and hailed her: “Mother mine, ill mother, of an ungentle heart, why turnest thou thus
away from my father, and dost not sit by him and question him and ask
him all? No other woman in the world would harden her heart to stand
thus aloof from her lord, who after much travail and sore had come to
her in the twentieth year to his own country. But thy heart is ever
harder than stone.” Then wise Penelope answered him, saying: “Child, my mind is amazed
within me, and I have no strength to speak, nor to ask him aught, nay
nor to look on him face to face. But if in truth this be Odysseus, and
he hath indeed come home, verily we shall be ware of each other the
more surely, for we have tokens that we twain know, even we, secret
from all others.",0.6558062650298717,dissimilar,recognition;identity;domestic setting - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both explore themes of recognition, identity, and the complexity of human relationships. Woolf's passage, with its focus on the seemingly mundane act of twirling a hat, contrasts with the epic scale of Penelope's recognition of Odysseus, yet both involve a deeper exploration of perception and reality.","Woolf's passage subtly echoes the Homeric theme of recognition, transforming it into a modernist exploration of identity and perception. By focusing on a domestic scene, Woolf reimagines the epic narrative through a feminist lens, highlighting the significance of everyday experiences."

But when thou art within the shadow of the halls and the court, pass
quickly through the great chamber, till thou comest to my mother, who
sits at the hearth in the light of the fire, weaving yarn of sea-purple
stain, a wonder to behold. Her chair is leaned against a pillar, and
her maidens sit behind her. And there my father’s throne leans close to
hers, wherein he sits and drinks his wine, like an immortal. Pass thou
by him, and cast thy hands about my mother’s knees, that thou mayest
see quickly and with joy the day of thy returning, even if thou art
from a very far country. If but her heart be kindly disposed toward
thee, then is there hope that thou shalt see thy friends, and come to
thy well-builded house, and to thine own country.” She spake, and smote the mules with the shining whip, and quickly they
left behind them the streams of the river. And well they trotted and
well they paced, and she took heed to drive in such wise that the
maidens and Odysseus might follow on foot, and cunningly she plied the
lash. Then the sun set, and they came to the famous grove, the sacred
place of Athene; so there the goodly Odysseus sat him down. Then
straightway he prayed to the daughter of mighty Zeus: “Listen to me,
child of Zeus, lord of the aegis, unwearied maiden; hear me even now,
since before thou heardest not when I was smitten on the sea, when the
renowned Earth-shaker smote me. Grant me to come to the Phaeacians as
one dear, and worthy of pity.",0.6566069521962346,dissimilar,craftsmanship;domestic setting;creation - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both involve domestic settings and activities, with a focus on craftsmanship and the creation of something substantial and real.","Woolf's passage subtly integrates Homeric elements by transforming the theme of domestic craftsmanship into a modernist exploration of identity and reality, reflecting her nuanced intertextual practice."
