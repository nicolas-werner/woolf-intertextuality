with Sally. (After all these years he really could not call her
""Lady Rosseter."") ""Where's the woman gone to?"" he asked. ""Where's
Clarissa?"" Sally supposed, and so did Peter for the matter of that, that there
were people of importance, politicians, whom neither of them knew
unless by sight in the picture papers, whom Clarissa had to be nice
to, had to talk to. She was with them. Yet there was Richard
Dalloway not in the Cabinet. He hadn't been a success, Sally
supposed? For herself, she scarcely ever read the papers. She
sometimes saw his name mentioned. But then--well, she lived a very
solitary life, in the wilds, Clarissa would say, among great
merchants, great manufacturers, men, after all, who did things."," And even if he hath perished as ye
deem, and is never more to return, yet by Apollo’s grace he hath a son
like him, Telemachus, and none of the women works wantonness in his
halls without his knowledge, for he is no longer of an age not to mark
it, Thus he spake, and the wise Penelope heard him, and rebuked the
handmaid, and spake and hailed her: “Thou reckless thing and unabashed, be sure thy great sin is not hidden
from me, and thy blood shall be on thine own head for the same! Four
thou knewest right well, in that thou hadst heard it from my lips, how
that I was minded to ask the stranger in my halls for tidings of my
lord; for I am grievously afflicted.” Therewith she spake likewise to the housedame, Eurynome, saying: “Eurynome, bring hither a settle with a fleece thereon, that the
stranger may sit and speak with me and hear my words, for I would ask
him all his story.” So she spake, and the nurse made haste and brought a polished settle,
and cast a fleece thereon; and then the steadfast goodly Odysseus sat
him down there, and the wise Penelope spake first, saying: “Stranger, I will make bold first to ask thee this: who art thou of the
sons of men, and whence? Where is thy city, and where are they that
begat thee?” And Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said: “Lady, no one of
mortal men in the wide world could find fault with thee, for lo, thy
fame goes up to the wide heaven, as doth the fame of a blameless king,
one that fears the gods and reigns among many men and mighty,
maintaining right, and the black earth bears wheat and barley, and the
trees are laden with fruit, and the sheep bring forth and fail not, and
the sea gives store of fish, and all out of his good guidance, and the
people prosper under him. Wherefore do thou ask me now in thy house all
else that thou wilt, but inquire not concerning my race and mine own
country, lest as I think thereupon thou fill my heart the more with
pains, for I am a man of many sorrows. Moreover it beseems me not to
sit weeping and wailing in another’s house, for it is little good to
mourn always without ceasing, lest perchance one of the maidens, or
even thyself, be angry with me and say that I swim in tears, as one
that is heavy with wine.” Then wise Penelope answered him, and said: “Stranger, surely my
excellence, both of face and form, the gods destroyed, in the day when
the Argives embarked for Ilios, and with them went my lord Odysseus. If
but he might come and watch over this my life, greater and fairer thus
would be my fame! But now am I in sorrow, such a host of ills some god
has sent against me. For all the noblest that are princes in the isles,
in Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus, and they that dwell around
even in clear-seen Ithaca, these are wooing me against my will, and
devouring the house. Wherefore I take no heed of strangers, nor
suppliants, nor at all of heralds, the craftsmen of the people. But I
waste my heart away in longing for Odysseus; so they speed on my
marriage and I weave a web of wiles.",0.6903023550693695,similar,absence;social expectations;longing - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both explore themes of absence and longing, with characters reflecting on the whereabouts and influence of significant figures in their lives.","Woolf subtly integrates Homeric themes of absence and societal roles into her modernist narrative, transforming epic motifs into a critique of contemporary social dynamics and gender expectations."

discreet man enough. So long as we are passing along the fields and
farms of men, do thou fare quickly with the maidens behind the mules
and the chariot, and I will lead the way. But when we set foot within
the city,—whereby goes a high wall with towers, and there is a fair
haven on either side of the town, and narrow is the entrance, and
curved ships are drawn up on either hand of the mole, for all the folk
have stations for their vessels, each man one for himself. And there is
the place of assembly about the goodly temple of Poseidon, furnished
with heavy stones, deep bedded in the earth. There men look to the gear
of the black ships, hawsers and sails, and there they fine down the
oars. For the Phaeacians care not for bow nor quiver, but for masts,
and oars of ships, and gallant barques, wherein rejoicing they cross
the grey sea. Their ungracious speech it is that I would avoid, lest
some man afterward rebuke me, and there are but too many insolent folk
among the people. And some one of the baser sort might meet me and say:
‘Who is this that goes with Nausicaa, this tall and goodly stranger?
Where found she him? Her husband he will be, her very own. Either she
has taken in some shipwrecked wanderer of strange men,—for no men dwell
near us; or some god has come in answer to her instant prayer; from
heaven has he descended, and will have her to wife for evermore. Better
so, if herself she has ranged abroad and found a lord from a strange
land, for verily she holds in no regard the Phaeacians here in this
country, the many men and noble who are her wooers.",0.6815748039573157,dissimilar,social obligations;societal expectations;navigation of social spaces - thematic,"The passages from *Mrs. Dalloway* and *The Odyssey* both explore themes of social interaction and the roles of individuals within societal structures. Woolf's passage focuses on Clarissa's social obligations and the perception of her role by others, while the Homeric passage deals with Nausicaa's interactions and the societal expectations surrounding her.","Woolf's passage subtly integrates Homeric themes by transforming the epic's focus on male heroism into a modernist exploration of female social roles and expectations. This transformation aligns with Woolf's feminist objectives, reimagining the epic narrative through a domestic lens."
