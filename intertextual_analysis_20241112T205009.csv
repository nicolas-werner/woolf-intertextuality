"Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself. For Lucy had her work cut out for her. The doors would be taken
off their hinges; Rumpelmayer's men were coming. And then, thought
Clarissa Dalloway, what a morning--fresh as if issued to children
on a beach. What a lark! What a plunge! For so it had always seemed to her,
when, with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now,
she had burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into
the open air. How fresh, how calm, stiller than this of course,
the air was in the early morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss
of a wave; chill and sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she
then was) solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at the open
window, that something awful was about to happen; looking at the
flowers, at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks
rising, falling; standing and looking until Peter Walsh said,
""Musing among the vegetables?""--was that it?--""I prefer men to
cauliflowers""--was that it? He must have said it at breakfast one
morning when she had gone out on to the terrace--Peter Walsh. He
would be back from India one of these days, June or July, she
forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull; it was his sayings
one remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his
grumpiness and, when millions of things had utterly vanished--how
strange it was!--a few sayings like this about cabbages. She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall's van to
pass. A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as
one does know people who live next door to one in Westminster); a
touch of the bird about her, of the jay, blue-green, light,
vivacious, though she was over fifty, and grown very white since
her illness."," If the lordly wooers shall slay me by
guile in the halls, and divide among them the heritage of my father,
then I should wish thee to keep and enjoy the gifts thyself, rather
than any of these. But if I shall sow the seeds of death and fate for
the wooers, then gladly bring me to the house the gifts that I will
gladly take.” Therewith he led the travel-worn stranger to the house. Now when they
came to the fair-lying palace, they laid aside their mantles on the
chairs and high seats, and went to the polished baths, and bathed them.
So when the maidens had bathed them and anointed them with olive oil,
and cast about them thick mantles and doublets, they came forth from
the baths, and sat upon the seats. Then the handmaid bare water for the
hands in a goodly golden ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin
to wash withal, and drew to their side a polished table. And the grave
dame bare wheaten bread, and set it by them, and laid on the board many
dainties, giving freely of such things as she had by her. And the
mother of Telemachus sat over against him by the pillar of the hall,
leaning against a chair, and spinning the slender threads from the
yarn. And they stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer set
before them. Now when they had put from them the desire of meat and
drink, the wise Penelope first spake among them: “Telemachus, verily I will go up to my upper chamber, and lay me in my
bed, the place of my groanings, that is ever watered by my tears, since
the day that Odysseus departed with the sons of Atreus for Ilios.",BOOK XVII.,0.7257353488123867,True,thematic parallel,high,"domesticity,homecoming,identity,memory,rituals,time","Both passages explore the themes of homecoming and identity through domestic settings, with Clarissa Dalloway reflecting on her past and Penelope mourning her husband's absence.

who straightway marvelled on the dream, and went through the halls to
tell her parents, her father dear and her mother. And she found them
within, her mother sitting by the hearth with the women her handmaids,
spinning yarn of sea-purple stain, but her father she met as he was
going forth to the renowned kings in their council, whither the noble
Phaeacians called him. Standing close by her dear father she spake,
saying: “Father, dear, couldst thou not lend me a high waggon with
strong wheels, that I may take the goodly raiment to the river to wash,
so much as I have lying soiled? Yea and it is seemly that thou thyself,
when thou art with the princes in council, shouldest have fresh raiment
to wear. Also, there are five dear sons of thine in the halls, two
married, but three are lusty bachelors, and these are always eager for
new-washen garments wherein to go to the dances; for all these things
have I taken thought.” This she said, because she was ashamed to speak of glad marriage to her
father; but he saw all and answered, saying: “Neither the mules nor aught else do I grudge thee, my child. Go thy
ways, and the thralls shall get thee ready a high waggon with good
wheels, and fitted with an upper frame.” Therewith he called to his men, and they gave ear, and without the
palace they made ready the smooth-running mule-wain, and led the mules
beneath the yoke, and harnessed them under the car, while the maiden
brought forth from her bower the shining raiment. This she stored in
the polished car, and her mother filled a basket with all manner of
food to the heart’s desire, dainties too she set therein, and she
poured wine into a goat-skin bottle, while Nausicaa climbed into the
wain. And her mother gave her soft olive oil also in a golden cruse,
that she and her maidens might anoint themselves after the bath. Then
Nausicaa took the whip and the shining reins, and touched the mules to
start them; then there was a clatter of hoofs, and on they strained
without flagging, with their load of the raiment and the maiden.",BOOK VI.,0.7220677384820512,True,thematic parallel,high,"domesticity,female agency,psychological depth,rituals of preparation,social conventions","Both passages depict women engaged in domestic tasks that reflect their societal roles.

had now come to the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the well-builded
roof, holding her glistening tire before her face, and on either side
of her stood a faithful handmaid. And straightway the knees of the
wooers were loosened, and their hearts were enchanted with love, and
each one uttered a prayer that he might be her bed-fellow. But she
spake to Telemachus, her dear son: “Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer stable as they
were. While thou wast still a child, thou hadst a yet quicker and more
crafty wit, but now that thou art great of growth, and art come to the
measure of manhood, and a stranger looking to thy stature and thy
beauty might say that thou must be some rich man’s son, thy mind and
thy thoughts are no longer right as of old. For lo, what manner of deed
has been done in these halls, in that thou hast suffered thy guest to
be thus shamefully dealt with. How would it be now, if the stranger
sitting thus in our house, were to come to some harm all through this
evil handling? Shame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mother mine, as to this matter I
count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have I knowledge and
understanding of each thing, of the good and of the evil; but
heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I cannot devise all things according
to wisdom, for these men in their evil counsel drive me from my wits,
on this side and on that, and there is none to aid me. Howsoever this
battle between Irus and the stranger did not fall out as the wooers
would have had it, but the stranger proved the better man.",BOOK XVIII.,0.7198219367790334,True,thematic parallel,high,"Epic Narrative,Gender Roles,Homecoming,Interior Monologue,Social Rituals","Both passages reflect on the characters' roles within their respective domestic spheres, with Clarissa's memories evoking a sense of nostalgia and identity crisis, while Penelope's dialogue with Telemachus emphasizes her authority and concern for their household.

Additionally, the sensory descriptions in both passages evoke a sense of place and time, with Woolf's modernist focus on the present moment contrasting with the epic's broader temporal scope.","In 'Mrs. Dalloway', the passage serves to establish Clarissa's character and her connection to her past, emphasizing her internal struggles and the weight of social expectations. It reflects her desire for agency in a world that often constrains her. In contrast, the passage from 'The Odyssey' highlights Penelope's role as a faithful wife and the importance of hospitality in ancient Greek culture. It underscores the tension between Odysseus's longing for home and the societal expectations placed on Penelope. While both passages deal with domesticity, Woolf's modernist approach allows for a more nuanced exploration of female identity and autonomy.","Homecoming,Identity,Domesticity,Waiting,Sensory Description,Social Expectations","The dialogue between the two texts reveals a transformation of traditional gender roles. Woolf's Clarissa embodies a modern woman grappling with her identity in a post-war society, while Penelope represents the archetypal faithful wife. Woolf's use of interior monologue contrasts with the epic's dialogue-driven narrative, allowing for a deeper exploration of Clarissa's psyche. This shift highlights the evolution of female agency from the classical to the modern context, suggesting a critique of the limitations placed on women in both eras.","Woolf transforms the classical narrative structure by focusing on the inner thoughts and feelings of her protagonist rather than external actions and heroic deeds. The emphasis on sensory experiences and the mundane aspects of life in 'Mrs. Dalloway' serves to elevate the everyday struggles of women, contrasting with the grand themes of honor and valor in 'The Odyssey'. This transformation allows Woolf to subvert the traditional male-dominated narrative by centering women's experiences and perspectives.","The similarities may be coincidental, reflecting broader themes in literature rather than direct intertextual engagement.,Woolf's modernist techniques may not directly reference Homer but instead draw from a common cultural understanding of domesticity and identity.","The passages create a meaningful intertextual dialogue that reflects the evolution of female identity and agency from the classical to the modern era. Woolf's reinterpretation of themes such as homecoming and domesticity challenges traditional narratives, offering a critical perspective on the roles of women in society. The semantic parallels suggest a conscious engagement with Homeric themes, but they also highlight the distinct cultural contexts in which each author operates."
