Italian girls sat making hats, he could see them; could hear them;
they were rubbing wires among coloured beads in saucers; they were
turning buckram shapes this way and that; the table was all strewn
with feathers, spangles, silks, ribbons; scissors were rapping on
the table; but something failed him; he could not feel. Still,
scissors rapping, girls laughing, hats being made protected him; he
was assured of safety; he had a refuge. But he could not sit there
all night. There were moments of waking in the early morning. The
bed was falling; he was falling. Oh for the scissors and the
lamplight and the buckram shapes! He asked Lucrezia to marry him,
the younger of the two, the gay, the frivolous, with those little
artist's fingers that she would hold up and say ""It is all in
them."" Silk, feathers, what not were alive to them. ""It is the hat that matters most,"" she would say, when they walked
out together. Every hat that passed, she would examine; and the
cloak and the dress and the way the woman held herself. Ill-
dressing, over-dressing she stigmatised, not savagely, rather with
impatient movements of the hands, like those of a painter who puts
from him some obvious well-meant glaring imposture; and then,
generously, but always critically, she would welcome a shopgirl who
had turned her little bit of stuff gallantly, or praise, wholly,
with enthusiastic and professional understanding, a French lady
descending from her carriage, in chinchilla, robes, pearls.";" Also this other wile she
contrived in her heart. She set up in her halls a mighty web, fine of
woof and very wide, whereat she would weave, and anon she spake among
us: “‘Ye princely youths, my wooers, now that goodly Odysseus is dead, do
ye abide patiently, how eager soever to speed on this marriage of mine,
till I finish the robe. I would not that the threads perish to no
avail, even this shroud for the hero Laertes, against the day when the
ruinous doom shall bring him low, of death that lays men at their
length. So shall none of the Achaean women in the land count it blame
in me, as well might be, were he to lie without a winding-sheet, a man
that had gotten great possessions.’ “So spake she, and our high hearts consented thereto. So then in the
daytime she would weave the mighty web, and in the night unravel the
same, when she had let place the torches by her. Thus for the space of
three years she hid the thing by guile and won the minds of the
Achaeans; but when the fourth year arrived and the seasons came round,
as the months waned and many days were accomplished, then it was that
one of her women who knew all declared it, and we found her unravelling
the splendid web. Thus she finished it perforce and sore against her
will. Now when she brought the robe to light, after she had woven the
great web and washed it, and it shone even as sun or moon, at that very
hour some evil god led Odysseus, I know not whence, to the upland farm,
where the swineherd abode in his dwelling. Thither too came the dear

the surface something which positively hurt him as it rose. Stop!
Stop! he wanted to cry. For he was not old; his life was not over;
not by any means. He was only just past fifty. Shall I tell her,
he thought, or not? He would like to make a clean breast of it
all. But she is too cold, he thought; sewing, with her scissors;
Daisy would look ordinary beside Clarissa. And she would think me
a failure, which I am in their sense, he thought; in the Dalloways'
sense. Oh yes, he had no doubt about that; he was a failure,
compared with all this--the inlaid table, the mounted paper-knife,
the dolphin and the candlesticks, the chair-covers and the old
valuable English tinted prints--he was a failure! I detest the
smugness of the whole affair, he thought; Richard's doing, not
Clarissa's; save that she married him. (Here Lucy came into the
room, carrying silver, more silver, but charming, slender, graceful
she looked, he thought, as she stooped to put it down.) And this
has been going on all the time! he thought; week after week;
Clarissa's life; while I--he thought; and at once everything seemed
to radiate from him; journeys; rides; quarrels; adventures; bridge
parties; love affairs; work; work, work! and he took out his knife
quite openly--his old horn-handled knife which Clarissa could swear
he had had these thirty years--and clenched his fist upon it.";"” With this word she went down from the shining upper chamber, not alone,

had now come to the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the well-builded
roof, holding her glistening tire before her face, and on either side
of her stood a faithful handmaid. And straightway the knees of the
wooers were loosened, and their hearts were enchanted with love, and
each one uttered a prayer that he might be her bed-fellow. But she
spake to Telemachus, her dear son: “Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer stable as they
were. While thou wast still a child, thou hadst a yet quicker and more
crafty wit, but now that thou art great of growth, and art come to the
measure of manhood, and a stranger looking to thy stature and thy
beauty might say that thou must be some rich man’s son, thy mind and
thy thoughts are no longer right as of old. For lo, what manner of deed
has been done in these halls, in that thou hast suffered thy guest to
be thus shamefully dealt with. How would it be now, if the stranger
sitting thus in our house, were to come to some harm all through this
evil handling? Shame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mother mine, as to this matter I
count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have I knowledge and
understanding of each thing, of the good and of the evil; but
heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I cannot devise all things according
to wisdom, for these men in their evil counsel drive me from my wits,

Hurlingham, what was it? she wondered, for the street was blocked.
The British middle classes sitting sideways on the tops of
omnibuses with parcels and umbrellas, yes, even furs on a day like
this, were, she thought, more ridiculous, more unlike anything
there has ever been than one could conceive; and the Queen herself
held up; the Queen herself unable to pass. Clarissa was suspended
on one side of Brook Street; Sir John Buckhurst, the old Judge on
the other, with the car between them (Sir John had laid down the
law for years and liked a well-dressed woman) when the chauffeur,
leaning ever so slightly, said or showed something to the
policeman, who saluted and raised his arm and jerked his head and
moved the omnibus to the side and the car passed through. Slowly
and very silently it took its way. Clarissa guessed; Clarissa knew of course; she had seen something
white, magical, circular, in the footman's hand, a disc inscribed
with a name,--the Queen's, the Prince of Wales's, the Prime
Minister's?--which, by force of its own lustre, burnt its way
through (Clarissa saw the car diminishing, disappearing), to blaze
among candelabras, glittering stars, breasts stiff with oak leaves,
Hugh Whitbread and all his colleagues, the gentlemen of England,
that night in Buckingham Palace. And Clarissa, too, gave a party.
She stiffened a little; so she would stand at the top of her
stairs. The car had gone, but it had left a slight ripple which flowed
through glove shops and hat shops and tailors' shops on both sides
of Bond Street. For thirty seconds all heads were inclined the
same way--to the window.";" And out of the house of Peisander the prince, the son of
Polyctor, the squire brought a necklet, a very lovely jewel. And
likewise the Achaeans brought each one some other beautiful gift. Then the fair lady went aloft to her upper chamber, and her attendant
maidens bare for her the lovely gifts, while the wooers turned to
dancing and the delight of song, and therein took their pleasure, and
awaited the coming of eventide. And dark evening came on them at their
pastime. Anon they set up three braziers in the halls, to give them
light, and on these they laid firewood all around, faggots seasoned
long since and sere, and new split with the axe. And midway by the
braziers they placed torches, and the maids of Odysseus, of the hardy
heart, held up the lights in turn. Then the prince Odysseus of many
counsels himself spake among them saying: “Ye maidens of Odysseus, the lord so long afar, get ye into the
chambers where the honoured queen abides, and twist the yarn at her
side, and gladden her heart as ye sit in the chamber, or card the wools
with your hands; but I will minister light to all these that are here.
For even if they are minded to wait the throned Dawn, they shall not
outstay me, so long enduring am I.” So he spake, but they laughed and looked one at the other. And the fair

expert;" Infinite numbers
of dull people conglomerated round her of course. But odd
unexpected people turned up; an artist sometimes; sometimes a
writer; queer fish in that atmosphere. And behind it all was that
network of visiting, leaving cards, being kind to people; running
about with bunches of flowers, little presents; So-and-so was going
to France--must have an air-cushion; a real drain on her strength;
all that interminable traffic that women of her sort keep up; but
she did it genuinely, from a natural instinct. Oddly enough, she was one of the most thoroughgoing sceptics he had
ever met, and possibly (this was a theory he used to make up to
account for her, so transparent in some ways, so inscrutable in
others), possibly she said to herself, As we are a doomed race,
chained to a sinking ship (her favourite reading as a girl was
Huxley and Tyndall, and they were fond of these nautical
metaphors), as the whole thing is a bad joke, let us, at any rate,
do our part; mitigate the sufferings of our fellow-prisoners
(Huxley again); decorate the dungeon with flowers and air-cushions;
be as decent as we possibly can. Those ruffians, the Gods, shan't
have it all their own way,--her notion being that the Gods, who
never lost a chance of hurting, thwarting and spoiling human lives
were seriously put out if, all the same, you behaved like a lady.
That phase came directly after Sylvia's death--that horrible
affair. To see your own sister killed by a falling tree (all
Justin Parry's fault--all his carelessness) before your very eyes,
a girl too on the verge of life, the most gifted of them, Clarissa
always said, was enough to turn one bitter. Later she wasn't so
positive perhaps; she thought there were no Gods; no one was to
blame; and so she evolved this atheist's religion of doing good for
the sake of goodness. And of course she enjoyed life immensely. It was her nature to
enjoy (though goodness only knows, she had her reserves; it was a
mere sketch, he often felt, that even he, after all these years,
could make of Clarissa).";"” Therewith the great slayer of Argos departed, but the lady nymph went
on her way to the great-hearted Odysseus, when she had heard the
message of Zeus. And there she found him sitting on the shore, and his
eyes were never dry of tears, and his sweet life was ebbing away as he
mourned for his return; for the nymph no more found favour in his
sight. Howsoever by night he would sleep by her, as needs he must, in
the hollow caves, unwilling lover by a willing lady. And in the
day-time he would sit on the rocks and on the beach, straining his soul
with tears, and groans, and griefs, and through his tears he would look
wistfully over the unharvested deep. So standing near him that fair
goddess spake to him: “Hapless man, sorrow no more I pray thee in this isle, nor let thy good
life waste away, for even now will I send thee hence with all my heart.
Nay, arise and cut long beams, and fashion a wide raft with the axe,
and lay deckings high thereupon, that it may bear thee over the misty
deep. And I will place therein bread and water, and red wine to thy
heart’s desire, to keep hunger far away. And I will put raiment upon
thee, and send a fair gale in thy wake, that so thou mayest come all
unharmed to thine own country, if indeed it be the good pleasure of the
gods who hold wide heaven, who are stronger than I am both to will and
to do.” So she spake, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus shuddered, and uttering
his voice spake to her winged words: “Herein, goddess, thou hast
plainly some other thought, and in no wise my furtherance, for that
thou biddest me to cross in a raft the great gulf of the sea so dread
and difficult, which not even the swift gallant ships pass over
rejoicing in the breeze of Zeus. Nor would I go aboard a raft to
displeasure thee, unless thou wilt deign, O goddess, to swear a great

they were rubbing wires among coloured beads in saucers; they were

with feathers, spangles, silks, ribbons; scissors were rapping on
the table; but something failed him; he could not feel. Still,

ye abide patiently, how eager soever to speed on this marriage of mine,

that had gotten great possessions.’ “So spake she, and our high hearts consented thereto. So then in the
daytime she would weave the mighty web, and in the night unravel the

Achaeans; but when the fourth year arrived and the seasons came round,
as the months waned and many days were accomplished, then it was that
one of her women who knew all declared it, and we found her unravelling
the splendid web. Thus she finished it perforce and sore against her
will. Now when she brought the robe to light, after she had woven the
great web and washed it, and it shone even as sun or moon, at that very

survives every other passion of mankind, Peter Walsh thought,
holding his pocket-knife at arm's length. She had been meeting
Major Orde, Daisy said in her last letter; said it on purpose he
knew; said it to make him jealous; he could see her wrinkling her
forehead as she wrote, wondering what she could say to hurt him;
and yet it made no difference; he was furious! All this pother of
coming to England and seeing lawyers wasn't to marry her, but to
prevent her from marrying anybody else. That was what tortured
him, that was what came over him when he saw Clarissa so calm, so
cold, so intent on her dress or whatever it was; realising what she
might have spared him, what she had reduced him to--a whimpering,
snivelling old ass. But women, he thought, shutting his pocket-
knife, don't know what passion is. They don't know the meaning of
it to men. Clarissa was as cold as an icicle. There she would sit
on the sofa by his side, let him take her hand, give him one kiss--
Here he was at the crossing. A sound interrupted him; a frail quivering sound, a voice bubbling
up without direction, vigour, beginning or end, running weakly and
shrilly and with an absence of all human meaning into ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo-- the voice of no age or sex, the voice of an ancient spring spouting
from the earth; which issued, just opposite Regent's Park Tube
station from a tall quivering shape, like a funnel, like a rusty
pump, like a wind-beaten tree for ever barren of leaves which lets
the wind run up and down its branches singing ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo and rocks and creaks and moans in the eternal breeze. Through all ages--when the pavement was grass, when it was swamp,
through the age of tusk and mammoth, through the age of silent
sunrise, the battered woman--for she wore a skirt--with her right
hand exposed, her left clutching at her side, stood singing of
love--love which has lasted a million years, she sang, love which
prevails, and millions of years ago, her lover, who had been dead
these centuries, had walked, she crooned, with her in May; but in
the course of ages, long as summer days, and flaming, she
remembered, with nothing but red asters, he had gone; death's
enormous sickle had swept those tremendous hills, and when at last
she laid her hoary and immensely aged head on the earth, now become
a mere cinder of ice, she implored the Gods to lay by her side a
bunch of purple-heather, there on her high burial place which the
last rays of the last sun caressed; for then the pageant of the
universe would be over. As the ancient song bubbled up opposite Regent's Park Tube station
still the earth seemed green and flowery; still, though it issued
from so rude a mouth, a mere hole in the earth, muddy too, matted
with root fibres and tangled grasses, still the old bubbling
burbling song, soaking through the knotted roots of infinite ages,
and skeletons and treasure, streamed away in rivulets over the
pavement and all along the Marylebone Road, and down towards
Euston, fertilising, leaving a damp stain.";" Then the

Since her illness she had turned almost white. Laying her brooch on the table, she had a sudden spasm, as if,
while she mused, the icy claws had had the chance to fix in her.
She was not old yet. She had just broken into her fifty-second
year. Months and months of it were still untouched. June, July,
August! Each still remained almost whole, and, as if to catch the
falling drop, Clarissa (crossing to the dressing-table) plunged
into the very heart of the moment, transfixed it, there--the moment
of this June morning on which was the pressure of all the other
mornings, seeing the glass, the dressing-table, and all the bottles
afresh, collecting the whole of her at one point (as she looked
into the glass), seeing the delicate pink face of the woman who was
that very night to give a party; of Clarissa Dalloway; of herself. How many million times she had seen her face, and always with the
same imperceptible contraction! She pursed her lips when she
looked in the glass. It was to give her face point. That was her
self--pointed; dartlike; definite. That was her self when some
effort, some call on her to be her self, drew the parts together,
she alone knew how different, how incompatible and composed so for
the world only into one centre, one diamond, one woman who sat in
her drawing-room and made a meeting-point, a radiancy no doubt in
some dull lives, a refuge for the lonely to come to, perhaps; she
had helped young people, who were grateful to her; had tried to be
the same always, never showing a sign of all the other sides of
her--faults, jealousies, vanities, suspicions, like this of Lady

all that interminable traffic that women of her sort keep up; but

chained to a sinking ship (her favourite reading as a girl was
Huxley and Tyndall, and they were fond of these nautical
metaphors), as the whole thing is a bad joke, let us, at any rate,
do our part; mitigate the sufferings of our fellow-prisoners

never lost a chance of hurting, thwarting and spoiling human lives
were seriously put out if, all the same, you behaved like a lady.

affair. To see your own sister killed by a falling tree (all
Justin Parry's fault--all his carelessness) before your very eyes,
a girl too on the verge of life, the most gifted of them, Clarissa
always said, was enough to turn one bitter. Later she wasn't so
positive perhaps; she thought there were no Gods; no one was to
blame; and so she evolved this atheist's religion of doing good for
the sake of goodness. And of course she enjoyed life immensely. It was her nature to

mourned for his return; for the nymph no more found favour in his

goddess spake to him: “Hapless man, sorrow no more I pray thee in this isle, nor let thy good
life waste away, for even now will I send thee hence with all my heart.
Nay, arise and cut long beams, and fashion a wide raft with the axe,
and lay deckings high thereupon, that it may bear thee over the misty
deep. And I will place therein bread and water, and red wine to thy
heart’s desire, to keep hunger far away. And I will put raiment upon
thee, and send a fair gale in thy wake, that so thou mayest come all
unharmed to thine own country, if indeed it be the good pleasure of the
gods who hold wide heaven, who are stronger than I am both to will and

his voice spake to her winged words: “Herein, goddess, thou hast
plainly some other thought, and in no wise my furtherance, for that
thou biddest me to cross in a raft the great gulf of the sea so dread

they like, and Elaine is training for the family business, and the
boy has won a scholarship at Leeds, and the old lady (who is about
his own age) has three more children at home; and they have two
motor cars, but Mr. Morris still mends the boots on Sunday: it is
superb, it is absolutely superb, thought Peter Walsh, swaying a
little backwards and forwards with his liqueur glass in his hand
among the hairy red chairs and ash-trays, feeling very well pleased
with himself, for the Morrises liked him. Yes, they liked a man
who said, ""Bartlett pears."" They liked him, he felt. He would go to Clarissa's party. (The Morrises moved off; but they
would meet again.) He would go to Clarissa's party, because he

smooth, and sheer, as it were polished. And in the midst of the cliff
is a dim cave turned to Erebus, towards the place of darkness, whereby
ye shall even steer your hollow ship, noble Odysseus. Not with an arrow
from a bow might a man in his strength reach from his hollow ship into
that deep cave. And therein dwelleth Scylla, yelping terribly. Her
voice indeed is no greater than the voice of a new-born whelp, but a
dreadful monster is she, nor would any look on her gladly, not if it
were a god that met her. Verily she hath twelve feet all dangling down;
and six necks exceeding long, and on each a hideous head, and therein
three rows of teeth set thick and close, full of black death. Up to her
middle is she sunk far down in the hollow cave, but forth she holds her
heads from the dreadful gulf, and there she fishes, swooping round the
rock, for dolphins or sea-dogs, or whatso greater beast she may
anywhere take, whereof the deep-voiced Amphitrite feeds countless
flocks. Thereby no sailors boast that they have fled scatheless ever
with their ship, for with each head she carries off a man, whom she
hath snatched from out the dark-prowed ship. “‘But that other cliff, Odysseus, thou shalt note, lying lower, hard by

sweet voices began the dirge; there thou wouldest not have seen an
Argive but wept, so mightily rose up the clear chant. Thus for

Hephaestus had utterly abolished thee, lo, in the morning we gathered
together thy white bones, Achilles, and bestowed them in unmixed wine

crafty wit, but now that thou art great of growth, and art come to the
measure of manhood, and a stranger looking to thy stature and thy

be thus shamefully dealt with. How would it be now, if the stranger
sitting thus in our house, were to come to some harm all through this
evil handling? Shame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mother mine, as to this matter I
count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have I knowledge and
understanding of each thing, of the good and of the evil; but
heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I cannot devise all things according

survives every other passion of mankind, Peter Walsh thought,

Major Orde, Daisy said in her last letter; said it on purpose he
knew; said it to make him jealous; he could see her wrinkling her
forehead as she wrote, wondering what she could say to hurt him;

coming to England and seeing lawyers wasn't to marry her, but to
prevent her from marrying anybody else. That was what tortured
him, that was what came over him when he saw Clarissa so calm, so
cold, so intent on her dress or whatever it was; realising what she
might have spared him, what she had reduced him to--a whimpering,
snivelling old ass. But women, he thought, shutting his pocket-
knife, don't know what passion is. They don't know the meaning of
it to men. Clarissa was as cold as an icicle. There she would sit

up without direction, vigour, beginning or end, running weakly and
shrilly and with an absence of all human meaning into ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo-- the voice of no age or sex, the voice of an ancient spring spouting
from the earth; which issued, just opposite Regent's Park Tube
station from a tall quivering shape, like a funnel, like a rusty
pump, like a wind-beaten tree for ever barren of leaves which lets
the wind run up and down its branches singing ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo and rocks and creaks and moans in the eternal breeze. Through all ages--when the pavement was grass, when it was swamp,
through the age of tusk and mammoth, through the age of silent
sunrise, the battered woman--for she wore a skirt--with her right
hand exposed, her left clutching at her side, stood singing of
love--love which has lasted a million years, she sang, love which
prevails, and millions of years ago, her lover, who had been dead
these centuries, had walked, she crooned, with her in May; but in
the course of ages, long as summer days, and flaming, she
remembered, with nothing but red asters, he had gone; death's
enormous sickle had swept those tremendous hills, and when at last
she laid her hoary and immensely aged head on the earth, now become
a mere cinder of ice, she implored the Gods to lay by her side a
bunch of purple-heather, there on her high burial place which the
last rays of the last sun caressed; for then the pageant of the
universe would be over. As the ancient song bubbled up opposite Regent's Park Tube station
still the earth seemed green and flowery; still, though it issued
from so rude a mouth, a mere hole in the earth, muddy too, matted
with root fibres and tangled grasses, still the old bubbling
burbling song, soaking through the knotted roots of infinite ages,
and skeletons and treasure, streamed away in rivulets over the
pavement and all along the Marylebone Road, and down towards
Euston, fertilising, leaving a damp stain.";" Then the

the thought of the past. But alas, Wilkins; Wilkins wanted her; Wilkins was emitting in a

a pitiful death; but even the death of this man Cronion hath left
untold. For none can surely declare the place where he hath perished,
whether he was smitten by foemen on the mainland, or lost upon the deep
among the waves of Amphitrite. So now am I come hither to thy knees, if
perchance thou art willing to tell me of his pitiful death, as one that
saw it with thine own eyes, or heard the story from some other
wanderer,—for his mother bare him to exceeding sorrow. And speak me no
soft words in ruth or pity, but tell me plainly what sight thou didst
get of him. Ah! I pray thee, if ever at all my father, noble Odysseus,
made promise to thee of word or work, and fulfilled the same in the
land of the Trojans, where ye Achaeans suffered affliction; these
things, I pray thee, now remember and tell me truth.” Then Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, answered him: “My friend,
since thou hast brought sorrow back to mind, behold, this is the story
of the woe which we endured in that land, we sons of the Achaeans,
unrestrained in fury, and of all that we bore in wanderings after
spoil, sailing with our ships over the misty deep, wheresoever Achilles
led; and of all our war round the mighty burg of king Priam. Yea and

another step into the pit. At last, with a melodramatic gesture which he assumed mechanically

archer god is held in the land, a holy feast. Who at such a time would
be bending bows? Nay, set it quietly by; what and if we should let the

Melanthius, the goatherd, to lead hither the very best goats in all his
herds, that we may lay pieces of the thighs on the altar of Apollo the
archer, and assay the bow and make an end of the contest.” So spake Antinous, and the saying pleased them well. Then the henchmen
poured water on their hands, and pages crowned the mixing-bowls with
drink, and served out the wine to all, when they had poured for
libation into each cup in turn. But when they had poured forth and had

heart within me bids. And mainly to Eurymachus I make my prayer and to
the godlike Antinous, forasmuch as he has spoken even this word aright,
namely, that for this present ye cease from your archery and leave the
issue to the gods; and in the morning the god will give the victory to
whomsoever he will. Come therefore, give me the polished bow, that in

while she mused, the icy claws had had the chance to fix in her.

year. Months and months of it were still untouched. June, July,
August! Each still remained almost whole, and, as if to catch the
falling drop, Clarissa (crossing to the dressing-table) plunged
into the very heart of the moment, transfixed it, there--the moment
of this June morning on which was the pressure of all the other
mornings, seeing the glass, the dressing-table, and all the bottles
afresh, collecting the whole of her at one point (as she looked
into the glass), seeing the delicate pink face of the woman who was
that very night to give a party; of Clarissa Dalloway; of herself. How many million times she had seen her face, and always with the
same imperceptible contraction! She pursed her lips when she
looked in the glass. It was to give her face point. That was her
self--pointed; dartlike; definite. That was her self when some
effort, some call on her to be her self, drew the parts together,

the world only into one centre, one diamond, one woman who sat in
her drawing-room and made a meeting-point, a radiancy no doubt in
some dull lives, a refuge for the lonely to come to, perhaps; she
had helped young people, who were grateful to her; had tried to be
the same always, never showing a sign of all the other sides of
her--faults, jealousies, vanities, suspicions, like this of Lady
Bruton not asking her to lunch; which, she thought (combing her
hair finally), is utterly base! Now, where was her dress? Her evening dresses hung in the cupboard.";"” With this word she went down from the shining upper chamber, not alone,

of her stood a faithful handmaid. And straightway the knees of the
wooers were loosened, and their hearts were enchanted with love, and
each one uttered a prayer that he might be her bed-fellow. But she
spake to Telemachus, her dear son: “Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer stable as they
were. While thou wast still a child, thou hadst a yet quicker and more
crafty wit, but now that thou art great of growth, and art come to the
measure of manhood, and a stranger looking to thy stature and thy
beauty might say that thou must be some rich man’s son, thy mind and
thy thoughts are no longer right as of old. For lo, what manner of deed
has been done in these halls, in that thou hast suffered thy guest to
be thus shamefully dealt with. How would it be now, if the stranger
sitting thus in our house, were to come to some harm all through this
evil handling? Shame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mother mine, as to this matter I
count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have I knowledge and
understanding of each thing, of the good and of the evil; but
heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I cannot devise all things according
to wisdom, for these men in their evil counsel drive me from my wits,

cold with excitement, and doing her hair in a kind of ecstasy (now
the old feeling began to come back to her, as she took out her
hairpins, laid them on the dressing-table, began to do her hair),
with the rooks flaunting up and down in the pink evening light, and
dressing, and going downstairs, and feeling as she crossed the hall

love?) as the complete indifference of other people. Aunt Helena

might have been there, and old Miss Cummings; Joseph Breitkopf
certainly was, for he came every summer, poor old man, for weeks
and weeks, and pretended to read German with her, but really played
the piano and sang Brahms without any voice. All this was only a background for Sally. She stood by the
fireplace talking, in that beautiful voice which made everything
she said sound like a caress, to Papa, who had begun to be
attracted rather against his will (he never got over lending her
one of his books and finding it soaked on the terrace), when

expert;" It was jealousy that was at the bottom of it--jealousy which
survives every other passion of mankind, Peter Walsh thought,
holding his pocket-knife at arm's length. She had been meeting
Major Orde, Daisy said in her last letter; said it on purpose he
knew; said it to make him jealous; he could see her wrinkling her
forehead as she wrote, wondering what she could say to hurt him;
and yet it made no difference; he was furious! All this pother of
coming to England and seeing lawyers wasn't to marry her, but to
prevent her from marrying anybody else. That was what tortured
him, that was what came over him when he saw Clarissa so calm, so
cold, so intent on her dress or whatever it was; realising what she
might have spared him, what she had reduced him to--a whimpering,
snivelling old ass. But women, he thought, shutting his pocket-
knife, don't know what passion is. They don't know the meaning of
it to men. Clarissa was as cold as an icicle. There she would sit
on the sofa by his side, let him take her hand, give him one kiss--
Here he was at the crossing. A sound interrupted him; a frail quivering sound, a voice bubbling
up without direction, vigour, beginning or end, running weakly and
shrilly and with an absence of all human meaning into ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo-- the voice of no age or sex, the voice of an ancient spring spouting
from the earth; which issued, just opposite Regent's Park Tube
station from a tall quivering shape, like a funnel, like a rusty
pump, like a wind-beaten tree for ever barren of leaves which lets
the wind run up and down its branches singing ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo and rocks and creaks and moans in the eternal breeze. Through all ages--when the pavement was grass, when it was swamp,
through the age of tusk and mammoth, through the age of silent
sunrise, the battered woman--for she wore a skirt--with her right
hand exposed, her left clutching at her side, stood singing of
love--love which has lasted a million years, she sang, love which
prevails, and millions of years ago, her lover, who had been dead
these centuries, had walked, she crooned, with her in May; but in
the course of ages, long as summer days, and flaming, she
remembered, with nothing but red asters, he had gone; death's
enormous sickle had swept those tremendous hills, and when at last
she laid her hoary and immensely aged head on the earth, now become
a mere cinder of ice, she implored the Gods to lay by her side a
bunch of purple-heather, there on her high burial place which the
last rays of the last sun caressed; for then the pageant of the
universe would be over. As the ancient song bubbled up opposite Regent's Park Tube station
still the earth seemed green and flowery; still, though it issued
from so rude a mouth, a mere hole in the earth, muddy too, matted
with root fibres and tangled grasses, still the old bubbling
burbling song, soaking through the knotted roots of infinite ages,
and skeletons and treasure, streamed away in rivulets over the
pavement and all along the Marylebone Road, and down towards
Euston, fertilising, leaving a damp stain.";" There he lies sorrowing and nurses his
mighty grief, for long desire of thy return, and old age withal comes
heavy upon him. Yea and even so did I too perish and meet my doom. It
was not the archer goddess of the keen sight, who slew me in my halls
with the visitation of her gentle shafts, nor did any sickness come
upon me, such as chiefly with a sad wasting draws the spirit from the
limbs; nay, it was my sore longing for thee, and for thy counsels,
great Odysseus, and for thy loving-kindness, that reft me of sweet
life.’ “So spake she, and I mused in my heart and would fain have embraced the
spirit of my mother dead. Thrice I sprang towards her, and was minded
to embrace her; thrice she flitted from my hands as a shadow or even as
a dream, and sharp grief arose ever at my heart. And uttering my voice
I spake to her winged words: “‘Mother mine, wherefore dost thou not abide me who am eager to clasp
thee, that even in Hades we twain may cast our arms each about the
other, and have our fill of chill lament? Is this but a phantom that
the high goddess Persephone hath sent me, to the end that I may groan
for more exceeding sorrow?’ “So spake I, and my lady mother answered me anon: ‘Ah me, my child, of
all men most ill-fated, Persephone, the daughter of Zeus, doth in no
wise deceive thee, but even on this wise it is with mortals when they
die. For the sinews no more bind together the flesh and the bones, but
the great force of burning fire abolishes these, so soon as the life
hath left the white bones, and the spirit like a dream flies forth and
hovers near. But haste with all thine heart toward the sunlight, and
mark all this, that even hereafter thou mayest tell it to thy wife.’ “Thus we twain held discourse together; and lo, the women came up, for
the high goddess Persephone sent them forth, all they that had been the

Peter Walsh, no family in the world can compare with the Morrises;
none whatever; and their relations to each other are perfect, and
they don't care a hang for the upper classes, and they like what
they like, and Elaine is training for the family business, and the
boy has won a scholarship at Leeds, and the old lady (who is about
his own age) has three more children at home; and they have two
motor cars, but Mr. Morris still mends the boots on Sunday: it is
superb, it is absolutely superb, thought Peter Walsh, swaying a
little backwards and forwards with his liqueur glass in his hand
among the hairy red chairs and ash-trays, feeling very well pleased
with himself, for the Morrises liked him. Yes, they liked a man
who said, ""Bartlett pears."" They liked him, he felt. He would go to Clarissa's party. (The Morrises moved off; but they
would meet again.) He would go to Clarissa's party, because he
wanted to ask Richard what they were doing in India--the
conservative duffers. And what's being acted? And music. .";" Now when we had come to the land that lies hard by, we
saw a cave on the border near to the sea, lofty and roofed over with
laurels, and there many flocks of sheep and goats were used to rest.
And about it a high outer court was built with stones, deep bedded, and
with tall pines and oaks with their high crown of leaves. And a man was
wont to sleep therein, of monstrous size, who shepherded his flocks
alone and afar, and was not conversant with others, but dwelt apart in
lawlessness of mind. Yea, for he was a monstrous thing and fashioned
marvellously, nor was he like to any man that lives by bread, but like
a wooded peak of the towering hills, which stands out apart and alone
from others. “Then I commanded the rest of my well-loved company to tarry there by
the ship, and to guard the ship, but I chose out twelve men, the best
of my company, and sallied forth. Now I had with me a goat-skin of the
dark wine and sweet which Maron, son of Euanthes, had given me, the
priest of Apollo, the god that watched over Ismarus. And he gave it,
for that we had protected him with his wife and child reverently; for
he dwelt in a thick grove of Phoebus Apollo. And he made me splendid
gifts; he gave me seven talents of gold well wrought, and he gave me a
mixing bowl of pure silver, and furthermore wine which he drew off in
twelve jars in all, sweet wine unmingled, a draught divine; nor did any
of his servants or of his handmaids in the house know thereof, but
himself and his dear wife and one housedame only. And as often as they
drank that red wine honey sweet, he would fill one cup and pour it into
twenty measures of water, and a marvellous sweet smell went up from the
mixing bowl: then truly it was no pleasure to refrain. “With this wine I filled a great skin, and bare it with me, and corn
too I put in a wallet, for my lordly spirit straightway had a boding

naive;" It was jealousy that was at the bottom of it--jealousy which
survives every other passion of mankind, Peter Walsh thought,
holding his pocket-knife at arm's length. She had been meeting
Major Orde, Daisy said in her last letter; said it on purpose he
knew; said it to make him jealous; he could see her wrinkling her
forehead as she wrote, wondering what she could say to hurt him;
and yet it made no difference; he was furious! All this pother of
coming to England and seeing lawyers wasn't to marry her, but to
prevent her from marrying anybody else. That was what tortured
him, that was what came over him when he saw Clarissa so calm, so
cold, so intent on her dress or whatever it was; realising what she
might have spared him, what she had reduced him to--a whimpering,
snivelling old ass. But women, he thought, shutting his pocket-
knife, don't know what passion is. They don't know the meaning of
it to men. Clarissa was as cold as an icicle. There she would sit
on the sofa by his side, let him take her hand, give him one kiss--
Here he was at the crossing. A sound interrupted him; a frail quivering sound, a voice bubbling
up without direction, vigour, beginning or end, running weakly and
shrilly and with an absence of all human meaning into ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo-- the voice of no age or sex, the voice of an ancient spring spouting
from the earth; which issued, just opposite Regent's Park Tube
station from a tall quivering shape, like a funnel, like a rusty
pump, like a wind-beaten tree for ever barren of leaves which lets
the wind run up and down its branches singing ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo and rocks and creaks and moans in the eternal breeze. Through all ages--when the pavement was grass, when it was swamp,
through the age of tusk and mammoth, through the age of silent
sunrise, the battered woman--for she wore a skirt--with her right
hand exposed, her left clutching at her side, stood singing of
love--love which has lasted a million years, she sang, love which
prevails, and millions of years ago, her lover, who had been dead
these centuries, had walked, she crooned, with her in May; but in
the course of ages, long as summer days, and flaming, she
remembered, with nothing but red asters, he had gone; death's
enormous sickle had swept those tremendous hills, and when at last
she laid her hoary and immensely aged head on the earth, now become
a mere cinder of ice, she implored the Gods to lay by her side a
bunch of purple-heather, there on her high burial place which the
last rays of the last sun caressed; for then the pageant of the
universe would be over. As the ancient song bubbled up opposite Regent's Park Tube station
still the earth seemed green and flowery; still, though it issued
from so rude a mouth, a mere hole in the earth, muddy too, matted
with root fibres and tangled grasses, still the old bubbling
burbling song, soaking through the knotted roots of infinite ages,
and skeletons and treasure, streamed away in rivulets over the
pavement and all along the Marylebone Road, and down towards
Euston, fertilising, leaving a damp stain.";" There he lies sorrowing and nurses his
mighty grief, for long desire of thy return, and old age withal comes
heavy upon him. Yea and even so did I too perish and meet my doom. It
was not the archer goddess of the keen sight, who slew me in my halls
with the visitation of her gentle shafts, nor did any sickness come
upon me, such as chiefly with a sad wasting draws the spirit from the
limbs; nay, it was my sore longing for thee, and for thy counsels,
great Odysseus, and for thy loving-kindness, that reft me of sweet
life.’ “So spake she, and I mused in my heart and would fain have embraced the
spirit of my mother dead. Thrice I sprang towards her, and was minded
to embrace her; thrice she flitted from my hands as a shadow or even as
a dream, and sharp grief arose ever at my heart. And uttering my voice
I spake to her winged words: “‘Mother mine, wherefore dost thou not abide me who am eager to clasp
thee, that even in Hades we twain may cast our arms each about the
other, and have our fill of chill lament? Is this but a phantom that
the high goddess Persephone hath sent me, to the end that I may groan
for more exceeding sorrow?’ “So spake I, and my lady mother answered me anon: ‘Ah me, my child, of
all men most ill-fated, Persephone, the daughter of Zeus, doth in no
wise deceive thee, but even on this wise it is with mortals when they
die. For the sinews no more bind together the flesh and the bones, but
the great force of burning fire abolishes these, so soon as the life
hath left the white bones, and the spirit like a dream flies forth and
hovers near. But haste with all thine heart toward the sunlight, and
mark all this, that even hereafter thou mayest tell it to thy wife.’ “Thus we twain held discourse together; and lo, the women came up, for
the high goddess Persephone sent them forth, all they that had been the
wives and daughters of mighty men. And they gathered and flocked about

been very, very intimate, she and Peter Walsh, when he was in love
with Clarissa, and there was that dreadful, ridiculous scene over
Richard Dalloway at lunch. She had called Richard ""Wickham."" Why
not call Richard ""Wickham""? Clarissa had flared up! and indeed
they had never seen each other since, she and Clarissa, not more

Walsh had gone off to India, and she had heard vaguely that he had
made an unhappy marriage, and she didn't know whether he had any
children, and she couldn't ask him, for he had changed. He was

this, were, she thought, more ridiculous, more unlike anything

held up; the Queen herself unable to pass. Clarissa was suspended
on one side of Brook Street; Sir John Buckhurst, the old Judge on
the other, with the car between them (Sir John had laid down the
law for years and liked a well-dressed woman) when the chauffeur,
leaning ever so slightly, said or showed something to the
policeman, who saluted and raised his arm and jerked his head and
moved the omnibus to the side and the car passed through. Slowly
and very silently it took its way. Clarissa guessed; Clarissa knew of course; she had seen something
white, magical, circular, in the footman's hand, a disc inscribed
with a name,--the Queen's, the Prince of Wales's, the Prime
Minister's?--which, by force of its own lustre, burnt its way
through (Clarissa saw the car diminishing, disappearing), to blaze
among candelabras, glittering stars, breasts stiff with oak leaves,
Hugh Whitbread and all his colleagues, the gentlemen of England,
that night in Buckingham Palace. And Clarissa, too, gave a party.

me, or know me not, so long have I been away,” Therewith he gave the thralls his weapons of war. Then they went

vineyard to make trial of his father. Now he found not Dolius there, as
he went down into the great garden, nor any of the thralls nor of their
sons. It chanced that they had all gone to gather stones for a garden
fence, and the old man at their head. So he found his father alone in
the terraced vineyard, digging about a plant. He was clothed in a
filthy doublet, patched and unseemly, with clouted leggings of oxhide
bound about his legs, against the scratches of the thorns, and long
sleeves over his hands by reason of the brambles, and on his head he
wore a goatskin cap, and so he nursed his sorrow. Now when the
steadfast goodly Odysseus saw his father thus wasted with age and in
great grief of heart, he stood still beneath a tall pear tree and let
fall a tear. Then he communed with his heart and soul, whether he
should fall on his father’s neck and kiss him, and tell him all, how he
had returned and come to his own country, or whether he should first
question him and prove him in every word. And as he thought within

chained to a sinking ship (her favourite reading as a girl was
Huxley and Tyndall, and they were fond of these nautical
metaphors), as the whole thing is a bad joke, let us, at any rate,
do our part; mitigate the sufferings of our fellow-prisoners

be as decent as we possibly can. Those ruffians, the Gods, shan't

affair. To see your own sister killed by a falling tree (all
Justin Parry's fault--all his carelessness) before your very eyes,

always said, was enough to turn one bitter. Later she wasn't so
positive perhaps; she thought there were no Gods; no one was to
blame; and so she evolved this atheist's religion of doing good for
the sake of goodness. And of course she enjoyed life immensely. It was her nature to

of dull people conglomerated round her of course. But odd

about with bunches of flowers, little presents; So-and-so was going
to France--must have an air-cushion; a real drain on her strength;
all that interminable traffic that women of her sort keep up; but
she did it genuinely, from a natural instinct. Oddly enough, she was one of the most thoroughgoing sceptics he had
ever met, and possibly (this was a theory he used to make up to
account for her, so transparent in some ways, so inscrutable in
others), possibly she said to herself, As we are a doomed race,
chained to a sinking ship (her favourite reading as a girl was
Huxley and Tyndall, and they were fond of these nautical
metaphors), as the whole thing is a bad joke, let us, at any rate,
do our part; mitigate the sufferings of our fellow-prisoners
(Huxley again); decorate the dungeon with flowers and air-cushions;
be as decent as we possibly can. Those ruffians, the Gods, shan't
have it all their own way,--her notion being that the Gods, who
never lost a chance of hurting, thwarting and spoiling human lives
were seriously put out if, all the same, you behaved like a lady.
That phase came directly after Sylvia's death--that horrible
affair. To see your own sister killed by a falling tree (all
Justin Parry's fault--all his carelessness) before your very eyes,
a girl too on the verge of life, the most gifted of them, Clarissa
always said, was enough to turn one bitter. Later she wasn't so
positive perhaps; she thought there were no Gods; no one was to
blame; and so she evolved this atheist's religion of doing good for
the sake of goodness. And of course she enjoyed life immensely. It was her nature to
enjoy (though goodness only knows, she had her reserves; it was a
mere sketch, he often felt, that even he, after all these years,
could make of Clarissa).";"Telemachus sends Eumaeus to the city to tell his mother of his return.

kindled a fire, and were making ready breakfast at the dawn, and had
sent forth the herdsmen with the droves of swine. And round Telemachus
the hounds, that love to bark, fawned and barked not, as he drew nigh.
And goodly Odysseus took note of the fawning of the dogs, and the noise
of footsteps fell upon his ears. Then straight he spake to Eumaeus

be here, for the dogs do not bark but fawn around, and I catch the
sound of footsteps.” While the word was yet on his lips, his own dear son stood at the

out of his hands fell the vessels wherewith he was busied in mingling
the dark wine. And he came over against his master and kissed his head

fall. And even as a loving father welcomes his son that has come in the
tenth year from a far country, his only son and well-beloved, for whose

and very silently it took its way. Clarissa guessed; Clarissa knew of course; she had seen something
white, magical, circular, in the footman's hand, a disc inscribed
with a name,--the Queen's, the Prince of Wales's, the Prime
Minister's?--which, by force of its own lustre, burnt its way
through (Clarissa saw the car diminishing, disappearing), to blaze
among candelabras, glittering stars, breasts stiff with oak leaves,
Hugh Whitbread and all his colleagues, the gentlemen of England,
that night in Buckingham Palace. And Clarissa, too, gave a party.
She stiffened a little; so she would stand at the top of her
stairs. The car had gone, but it had left a slight ripple which flowed
through glove shops and hat shops and tailors' shops on both sides
of Bond Street. For thirty seconds all heads were inclined the
same way--to the window.";" There Odysseus spake to his thralls and to
his son, saying: “Do ye now get you within the well-builded house, and quickly sacrifice
the best of the swine for the midday meal, but I will make trial of my
father, whether he will know me again and be aware of me when he sees
me, or know me not, so long have I been away,” Therewith he gave the thralls his weapons of war. Then they went
speedily to the house, while Odysseus drew near to the fruitful
vineyard to make trial of his father. Now he found not Dolius there, as
he went down into the great garden, nor any of the thralls nor of their
sons. It chanced that they had all gone to gather stones for a garden
fence, and the old man at their head. So he found his father alone in
the terraced vineyard, digging about a plant. He was clothed in a
filthy doublet, patched and unseemly, with clouted leggings of oxhide
bound about his legs, against the scratches of the thorns, and long
sleeves over his hands by reason of the brambles, and on his head he
wore a goatskin cap, and so he nursed his sorrow. Now when the
steadfast goodly Odysseus saw his father thus wasted with age and in
great grief of heart, he stood still beneath a tall pear tree and let
fall a tear. Then he communed with his heart and soul, whether he
should fall on his father’s neck and kiss him, and tell him all, how he
had returned and come to his own country, or whether he should first
question him and prove him in every word. And as he thought within
himself, this seemed to him the better way, namely, first to prove his
father and speak to him sharply. So with this intent the goodly
Odysseus went up to him.";most_dissimilar;0.6036355658405904;The passages from Mrs. Dalloway and The Odyssey both involve themes of recognition and social status, though they manifest in different contexts.

blotting her out. He pursued; she changed. There was colour in
her cheeks; mockery in her eyes; he was an adventurer, reckless, he
thought, swift, daring, indeed (landed as he was last night from
India) a romantic buccaneer, careless of all these damned
proprieties, yellow dressing-gowns, pipes, fishing-rods, in the
shop windows; and respectability and evening parties and spruce old
men wearing white slips beneath their waistcoats. He was a
buccaneer. On and on she went, across Piccadilly, and up Regent
Street, ahead of him, her cloak, her gloves, her shoulders
combining with the fringes and the laces and the feather boas in
the windows to make the spirit of finery and whimsy which dwindled
out of the shops on to the pavement, as the light of a lamp goes
wavering at night over hedges in the darkness. Laughing and delightful, she had crossed Oxford Street and Great
Portland Street and turned down one of the little streets, and now,
and now, the great moment was approaching, for now she slackened,
opened her bag, and with one look in his direction, but not at him,
one look that bade farewell, summed up the whole situation and
dismissed it triumphantly, for ever, had fitted her key, opened the
door, and gone! Clarissa's voice saying, Remember my party,
Remember my party, sang in his ears. The house was one of those
flat red houses with hanging flower-baskets of vague impropriety.
It was over. Well, I've had my fun; I've had it, he thought, looking up at the
swinging baskets of pale geraniums. And it was smashed to atoms--
his fun, for it was half made up, as he knew very well; invented,
this escapade with the girl; made up, as one makes up the better
part of life, he thought--making oneself up; making her up;
creating an exquisite amusement, and something more.";"Nestor entertains Telemachus at Pylos and tells him how the Greeks
departed from Troy; and sends him for further information to Sparta. Now the sun arose and left the lovely mere, speeding to the brazen
heaven, to give light to the immortals and to mortal men on the earth,
the graingiver, and they reached Pylos, the stablished castle of
Neleus. There the people were doing sacrifice on the sea shore, slaying
black bulls without spot to the dark-haired god, the shaker of the
earth. Nine companies there were, and five hundred men sat in each, and
in every company they held nine bulls ready to hand. Just as they had
tasted the inner parts, and were burning the slices of the thighs on
the altar to the god, the others were bearing straight to land, and
brailed up the sails of the gallant ship, and moored her, and
themselves came forth. And Telemachus too stept forth from the ship,
and Athene led the way. And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake first
to him, saying: “Telemachus, thou needst not now be abashed, no, not one whit. For to
this very end didst thou sail over the deep, that thou mightest hear
tidings of thy father, even where the earth closed over him, and what
manner of death he met. But come now, go straight to Nestor, tamer of
horses: let us learn what counsel he hath in the secret of his heart.
