## Woolf and Intertextuality (Woolf in Context - Chapter 5: Woolf and Intertextuality)

### Subtle and Integrated References

    "Woolf evolved a style of highly integrated intertextual references, much harder to identify than allusions in the texts of her fellow modernists" (p.54)
    Unlike Eliot and Joyce who are "eager for us to get the joke and, in getting it, to recognize how smart they are; even when Woolf is joking, she does not much care if we get it or not" (p.55)

### Multiple Layers

    "Woolian intertextuality operates at every level, from the word and phoneme through sentence, character, and plot to genre itself" (p.55)
    "any note that does more than cite chapter and verse will reveal something of the editor's perspective" (p.54)
    Creates "ironic buried commentaries, playing at once with the syntactic greatness of an early work and her distance from it as a modern feminist reader" (p.61)

### Hidden Depths

    "Rifaterre's useful distinction insufficiently accounts for the many intertextual moments in Woolf that have not gone noticed at all, moments that do not signal to the serious reader" (p.60)
    "The presence of Agamemnon behind Mrs Dalloway is not for the reader at all; it is Woolf's gift to the text itself, a secret fount of pleasure" (p.60)
    "The best strategy for identifying these secret founts is the careful study of the paratexts Woolf wrote just before and during the composition of her major works" (p.60)

### Feminist Reinterpretation

    "Woolf's intertextual moments carry within them a conviction of the great – and underappreciated – merits of women and the great injustices of patriarchy" (p.62)
    "Woolian intertextuality – feminist to its core, focused more on the pleasure of the text than phallic anxiety, and passionately engaged with both a patriarchal and a matriarchal canon" (p.62)
    "demonstrates how to persist as readers and admirers of a tradition that still tends to forget about women" (p.62)

### Genre and Theme Links

    "Harder to identify and, I would argue, more central to Woolf's work, is the larger scale intertextual resonances that link texts by genre and theme" (p.59)
    Example with Mrs. Dalloway: "The 'Mrs' announces Mrs Dalloway as a novel about middle age and resonates with Madame Bovary, a key precursor text for the modernists and a novel about a woman fatally unhappy in her marriage" (p.59)

### Important Context for Your Research

    While writing Mrs. Dalloway, Woolf was "translating Aeschylus' Agamemnon, a play which stands in a powerful but oblique relationship to that novel" (p.60). The article notes that Woolf engages with classical themes while "leaving others – bloodshed, rivalry, the law, and revenge – behind. Mrs Dalloway does not in any sense rewrite Agamemnon, but reading Agamemnon with Mrs Dalloway in mind reveals aspects of the play – images, character types, emotions – that seeped into the novel" (p.60).

This suggests that when looking for Homeric references in Mrs. Dalloway, you should:

    Look for thematic parallels rather than direct quotations
    Consider how classical themes might be transformed or subverted
    Examine both micro-level (word choice) and macro-level (plot structure) connections
    Research what other classical texts Woolf was reading during the composition period

„Mrs. Dalloway languishes in the shadow of and in response to James Joyce’s Ulysses, a mock-epic version of Homer’s epic, The Odyssey.“ ([Hoff, 2018, pp. -](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=9&annotation=ZYJP8Q4J))

„3.7/3.16 Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself: The myth introduces Demeter whose daughter Persephone is carried away when she had been gathering flowers. Philetas, a model for elegiac poets, related the Rape of Persephone in his elegiac poem Demeter. See Propertius 2.34.31, 3.1.1, 3.3.52 and 4.6.3. (Europa too was carried away by the Zeus-bull as she gathered flowers.) Just as Athena is the goddess who opens and closes the Odyssey and Venus is the goddess similarly in charge of the Aeneid, it will be shown that the goddess Demeter and her daughter Persephone open and close Mrs. Dalloway.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=21&annotation=5WG4JSP9))

„5.16-17/4.35-36 strange high singing of some aeroplane: This is the first appearance of the aeroplane that Clarissa seemingly never fully takes into her awareness. The singing of this aeroplane is reminiscent of the singing that appears frequently in Homer’s Odyssey which opens with the famous invocation- “Sing, Muse, the story of the man.” Antiquity, like the Odyssey, is studded with women who sing mnemonic chants while they weave the intricate patterns of their textiles. Both Calypso and Circe sing while they compose their fabrics (Odyssey 5.62-63 and 10.234-235). Penelope’s woven cloth is a eulogy in fabric (Barber Prehistoric Textiles 380). Helen of Troy is seen weaving her cloth with its story of “the many struggles of the horse-taming Trojans” (Iliad 3.125-127). The image of song while weaving is also found in the odes of Pindar (“Olympia” 1, “Pythia” 1, and “Nemeia” 1). This singing aeroplane will later weave a text in the sky.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=29&annotation=SZEIXP4H))

„perfect hostess: In the Iliad 15.87 and 20.5 the hostess on Olympus is the goddess Themis who is the wife of Zeus and the protector of hospitality. (See also Themis by the scholar Jane Ellen Harrison). Themis convenes the assembly of gods. She presides over the banquet. Technically speaking, Themis begins with convention, “what society compels.” (Harrison Themis 482-483). “In a larger sense Themis is the substratum of each and every god” (Harrison Themis 485), a factor that seems to make everything so heavenly in Clarissa’s eyes. Thus it is possible to see Hera and Demeter, among the many spouses of Zeus, in Clarissa’s nature as well. Zeus’s other affiliations include Leda, Alcmena, Semele, Maia, Europa, Antiope, and Danaë. The elegiac Zeus is the “Don Juan-like god of innumerable mistresses” (Veyne 27). See Proust 2.715. Jane Harrison (Prolegomena 368) comments that Zeus was a diner-out, a double meaning that disquiets Clarissa, given Zeus’s relaxed attitude toward monogamy. Richard (while here events seem to suggest his living up to the misnomer “Wickham”) in his “divine simplicity” seems to be sticking it out with Clarissa, however, which is a plus. The hostess is a frequent component in Proust 2.388, 415, 439, 769; 2.333; 3.40, 272, 273, 711 and, sometimes a derogatory suggestion is variously nuanced. In ancient literature, the perfect hostesses are Dido of Virgil’s Aeneid and Calypso of Homer’s Odyssey. Each tries to hold back the parting guest. Bergson has seen that “the transposition from the ancient to the modern [is] always a laughable one.” “It is comic to fall into a ready-made category.”“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 26](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=37&annotation=KBTNW2A4))

„11.7-9/8.26-27 at the same time was outside looking on: This suggests a bicameral mind. See Leonard Woolf ’s The Wise Virgins 149: “He seemed to be divided into several consciousnesses, one watching the other.” It also serves as an allusion to the position of the narrator in free indirect discourse, speaking as an outside observer yet using the character’s idiom. In the Odyssey the epic hero is often both the star and the narrator of his story.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=38&annotation=2MBD7ZZB))

„18.11/13.15 clean from a laundry laid in wicker trays: This relates to the story Eumaeus tells of the slave girl abducted by a merchant while doing laundry (Odyssey 15. 420-422). Nausicaa is doing the laundry on the beach when she encounters Odysseus.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=51&annotation=C8PEBUWI))

„19.7/13.35 pistol shot: The explosion, the backfiring car (or the blown-out tire) which suggests an Aristophanic fart, links two sections of the text and bridges the separate consciousnesses of several characters by calling attention to the mysterious car. As a “fart” it causes Miss Pym to apologize as if she had been the cause. As an explosion it has no effect whatever on Septimus Smith, the shell-shocked veteran, however much it has suggested the war to some readers. It suggests a proleptic reference to Adolf Hitler’s Beer Hall Putsch of November 1923, instead, which was punctuated by pistol fire. The distant scent of flowers and the scents from Atkinson’s scent shop (at 24 Old Bond Street according to Morris Beja), and the lack of the smell of cordite contrast with the smell of crepitation as a “backfiring.” See also Proust 1. 589: “like the sound of a revolver”, “the smoke of a pistol shot”, “the dust of the explosion.” The tire as a bag of wind suggests the Homeric episode conserning the bag of wind given to Odysseus (Odyssey 10), and the allusion in Joyce’s Ulysses, “Aeolus.” The same reference applies to the man with the leather bag ending the next chapter. The explosion ricochets all the way into Clarissa’s party as the component she requires for the success of the event when Ralph Lyon beats back the curtain with the birds of paradise on them, as if his fart caused the event. It’s the fart that gets the notice, not the curtain. The pistol shot forms a segue reaching into the next section. “Each chapter gains from the one before it or adds to the one that follows it” (CR 103).“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=52&annotation=2KAGHCDT))

See the wax in Juvenal Satires 9.150. See also Horace Epistles 1.2.53. The context, here, is hardly epic. 28.25/19.37-20.1 the Albany: A large residential structure in Pi“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 49](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=60&annotation=WDCGTYJI))

„41.26/28.29 bag stuffed with pamphlets: This is a self-reference to the novel itself as a bag of printed matter, stuffed with parodies and allusions. The novel achieves selfdefinition through containing simpler versions of itself usually in such terms of containment. These cameo performances are stories of art. The pamphlets may imply an activist political effort in the form of propaganda or “hot air.” In this case the leather bag suggests a parallel with Aeolus, the god of winds in the Odyssey 10.1ff, who captured winds in a bag to assist Odysseus in his voyage. The winds, when surreptitiously released, impede the Homeric hero’s progress (Homer Odyssey 10.38-55). 42.3/28.31-32 knocking of words together: This“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=68&annotation=Q9AXAFJ4))

„45.26-46.1/31.15-16 Narrower and narrower would her bed be: The sentence order is reversed as in free indirect discourse, foregrounding this important concept. See the convention of the narrow bed created in the Latin elegies of Propertius 1.8b and 2.1, punning on lecto, bed/something read, and narrow (angusto) meaning refined (McNamee 233). The narrow bed is understood to mean the small poem. Latin elegy, actually a satirical meta-literature, possesses a full set of textual and contextual characteristics for its identification, one of which is minimalism. The narrow bed is a term of art, something more specific than the words would indicate, and a metalingual expression of the need to read the “code.” It is a technical term. “A bed is a serious item for an elegist” (Benediktson 57). In the elegies of Propertius the narrow bed is the love nest, the elegiac genre, and the poem he writes, all at once or severally when the sense requires it. In these contexts, this novel can refer to a real bed (the bed where Clarissa puts her hat), the style in which it is narrated (which is characteristically elegiac), and the novel itself (Clarissa’s love story) which is clearly a metaphorical couch in which she rests. It is flexible according to the rhetorical demands. The elegies of Propertius, his love poems, ironic and half-tearful, halfmocking, set the tone of Mrs. Dalloway As a poem, the bed is narrow, since in elegy the literary work is small, not large like epic. Elegy is scaled down both in language and length; it is ruined if everything is gone into. “One must economise.” It further satirizes values; the elegiac way of life is superiormake love not war. The heroic code is bankrupt. In the cultivated persiflage of Propertius, philology always trumps reality. The narrow bed, a feature of the elegiac lexicon, is a notorious Propertian catchphrase “couched in the discourse of literary criticism” (Keith 49). The narrow bed illustrates the multitasking act of making love and writing about it as the same kind of activity. Sophisticated readers perceiving the ars poetica as the ars amatoria may enjoy the seductions of style. Others may not. So, in Swift’s Battle of the Books, a landmark in satires on the standards of criticism, the moderns preferred naturalism to conventions and styles of classicising literature.Thus Molière’s Alceste attacks a love elegy, The Annotations 65 preferring a folk-song thought to be closer to nature. Still, elegy exposes the twin themes of the identification of loving as writing, the interlocking themes of being loved and being read, an elegiac trope. In Euripides’s Alcestis, the queen addresses a farewell to her bed, a symbol of her wifely duty. See also Matthew Arnold’s poem “The Last Word”: “Creep into thy narrow bed.” Beds have further significance in literature, notably the bed made by Odysseus (Odyssey 23.184-204), the bed of Hephaestos (Odyssey 8.266-299),the fabulous bed of Procrustes, and the painted bed of Socrates (Republic 10.597). For the ruse of the bed in the Odyssey see Zeitlin in Cohen 117-152. For Plato, the ideal bed, the wooden bed, and the painted (imitation) bed have decreasing levels of reality. A copy of a painted bed or even a parody of such a passage is even more “unreal.”“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 64](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=75&annotation=RQ8K4TGE))

„47. 4-5/32.26-27 she did undoubtedly then feel what men felt: Here, philology recapitulates biology in androgynous gender play (Smith). Knowledge is sexy, and always The Annotations 67 has been even long before Adam knew Eve. Clarissa’s “revelation” answers Samuel Butler’s assertion that the Odyssey must have been written by a woman (in The Authoress of the Odyssey) who could have no idea how a man feels about love. Clarissa is in robust debate with the unnamed Butler, an example of preterition applied to intertextuality. The imagery shows that she does indeed understand and has accepted the challenge. The Homeric motif will be taken up in detail by Peter Walsh. Samuel Butler is credited with saying “Wise men never say what they think of women” in A Room of One’s Own, (29). Samuel Butler concludes that Nausicaa is the authoress of the Odyssey. In Wise Virgins 96 Leonard Woolf uses a similar allusion “I wonder if any woman understands what it is to a man.” Butler was much-read in this period (Graves 90). According to Susanne Langer, “The heroines of comedy are like the women of the world [...] Comedy is an exhibition of their battle with men” (125). The irony of Clarissa’s dialogue with Butler on the female authorship of the epic is resumed with her later suggestion that men would have no idea of how she felt either and Peter’s affirmations of Butler’s opinion which he adheres to as constructed. Nevertheless, “women feel just as men feel” (AROO 72). See Woolf ’s reference to the authoress of the Odyssey in her essay, “The Intellectual Status of Women” (Diary II , 339-340). According to Henry Festing Jones, Butler was quite serious about his theory that the Odyssey was drawn from life and written by a woman on the island of Sicily. Butler is one of those authors with a “fierce attachment to an idea [...] something believed in with conviction [...] compelling words to its shape” (CR 221). He was not often taken seriously (Jones 105-147 and 279-281). Ellen Terry thought the plays of Shakespeare had been written by a woman.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 66](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=77&annotation=GM3H8WYL))

„52.10/35.20 that beautiful voice: A reference to the Sappho fragment 31 LP. The fragment describes a makarismos (a scenario of blessedness, beatitude), the voice so beautiful that it makes its hearers “blessed,” and thus vulnerable to divine phthonos. The man hearing the voice in this case “must be like a god” to survive the experience. The speaker is near death. See the extended makarismos in Odyssey 6.149-161 and a shorter passage in 6.243.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=83&annotation=Y4ILQQID))

„53.14/36.10 a flash of lightning: In Odyssey 20, 100-121 Zeus gives Odysseus a flash of lightning as a sign that his vengeance against the suitors will be successful. Lightning, éclair, will reappear when Kilman eats at the Army and Navy Stores. Woolf has said that Ottoline Morrell would appear in her work in a flash of lighting; the reference to which case applies is ambiguous—not the reference here to Sally presumably.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 76](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=87&annotation=F5A4ZW64))

„55.15/37.23 never showing all the other sides of her: Invisible presences. The faceted character of a diamond she describes resembles the analytic phase of Cubism. Her multivalency, her overdetermined nature, is a function of performing multiple roles. We may see all sides at once. Clarissa’s many-sidedness suggests she is a shape-shifter, like protean sea-goddesses who contain the shapes of everything. Thetis assumed protean shapes while wrestling with Peleus. Reality is a chameleon quality and fantasy is closer to the truth (CR 49). We are often invited to expect a personality that differs from the Clarissa on display. She is never thoroughly known or defined, Samuel Butler suggests that in the Odyssey, several roles are played by the same person. See the similar “negative capability” of Vertumnus (Propertius 4.2) whose constructed gender identity is a function of his costume. Like “Agathon” in Aristophanes’s Thesmophoriazusae (101-129) whose poetics is determined by his costumes, poets dress like women when singing about them.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 78](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=89&annotation=B99P4J39))

„56.6/38.1-2 and see that things generally were more or less in order: The temporal sequence of Mrs. Dalloway is almost never “in order” due to flashback technique such as found in the Odyssey.

„58.19-21/39.27 Quiet descended etc: Sewing, typically the sartorial metaphor for assembling a text, is here a genre scene (“woman sewing”) that anticipates Rezia’s similar scene. Euripedes makes similar use of banausic metaphors. For stitchery as the craft of rhapsodes see Pindar “Nemean” 2. Here Clarissa is the rhapsode sewing her textum. Then the first major character enters. She resembles Helen weaving “a great web,” an historical tapestry in her Trojan drawing room (Iliad 3.125-128) as well as the textiles woven by Calypso and Circe in the Odyssey, and most notably, Penelope whose ruse of weaving and unweaving her work thereby keeping the importuning suitors at a distance turns time back and forth, each operation an ending and a beginning. Please refer to Laura Slatkin “Composition” 235-236 for a discussion of needle work and weaving. The working of fabric within the composition of the fabric of the text “constitutes the device itself ” (Slatkin The Annotations 81 “Odyssey” 236). 58.23-59.4. Clarissa’s “spinning song” is a lyric passage constructed in the form of ring composition: Waves collect, overbalance, and fall. collect and fall [...] “that is all.” The heart in the body which lies on the beach says too That is all Fear no more says the heart Fear no more says the heart.[...] Renews, begins, collects, lets fall. “Ring structure, concentric panels (in which the narrative leads to a central point and then retraces its steps outward)” is highly artificial and labyrinthine in its symmetries (Doob 246; see also Thalmann). Since ring composition is the predominating structure in this novel it follows that Mrs. Dalloway manifests the traditional complexity and artistry of the labyrinth. This ring, that appeared earlier as rooks rising and falling, echoes Ovid Amores 1.7.1718 in which elegiac couplets are imaged: “When my new page has risen up (surrexit) well [...] the next verse diminishes (attenuat) my [literary vigour]” (Duncan Kennedy 59). “Gathered together in this scene are thematic filaments that extend throughout the text, often intertwined with each other [...] In turn, the collecting of waves and silk is related to other modes of assembling—Rezia’s millinery; the party for which Clarissa is preparing her dress, and which will bring together present and past; and finally life and death” (von Klemperer 126).“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 80](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=91&annotation=EBTDAQ6J))

Herodotus is quite cynical in his belief that no young woman allows herself to be abducted if she does not wish to be. This will be relevant to Clarissa as well. Like Callimachus, the narrator ridicules Peter for slavishly repeating Homer’s Odyssey when the epic form is now obsolete.

„66.5/44.23 Before a battle begins: Odysseus’s visit with Helen, as she recounts in the Odyssey, occurs before the final battle in the Trojan War. The mock battle between Clarissa and Peter is a dialogue styled as a Stilkampf, often a literary opposition between the slender and the fat, or between comedy and tragedy. It is a device that reveals the outward expression of inward postures. Stilkampf applies to stichomythia as well as to robust debate. In its Greek form it is called agon. Here it is hardly a serious joust: “mere horseplay,” a mock-battle (See Juvenal 15.60). The weapons are a needle and a penknife.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 86](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=97&annotation=WSX7KQAR))

„68.19-21/46.7 She flattered him; she fooled him [...] What a folly!: Exclamations and associated punctuation indicate free indirect discourse. The flattery resembles the flattery Calypso exercised on Odysseus (Odyssey 1.56f ) , the vamp who had been attempting to make the hero immortal. Clarissa is reading between the lines. Folly is clearly a motif in this novel about fools.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 87](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=98&annotation=GHQJXP4B))

Peter’s emotional involvement is opposed to Clarissa’s aesthetic distance. This is behavior typical in epic heroes and elegiac lovers. In Propertius 88 Virginia Woolf ’s Mrs. Dalloway the dominance of the puella is manifest (4.1.70): “You will not even weep unless you’re told.” Clarissa causa fuit. See Odysseus himself weeping among the Phaiakians in Odyssey 8.523-530.

„73. 23/49.22 told her everything: He has spilled the beans, as if he told her of the wooden horse ruse like the hero did, recounted in Odysseus’s visit with Helen and Menelaus, above (Odyssey 4. 256, 598-99). At that time Helen saw through his disguise as a beggar as Penelope will at Ithaca. As in the Homeric poems the narrative is highly formulaic; on almost every page there is a set of words that occurs elsewhere. The episodic character of the narrative alternates with real pathos and comic relief. As in Homer, the last chapter picks up the themes introduced at the beginning and ends with those with which it began. Like Homer’s epics there are frequent repetitions and inconsistencies. Such allusions suggest “an attempt to impose an artistic order on life” (Kellman Self-begetting Novel 15). The Homeric parallels undergo a transformation that will give Mrs. Dalloway its elegiac (amorous) character. Thus it aligns itself with the elegies of Propertius and the “elegiacization of Homer” (Benediktson). See for example Propertius 4.8 in which Cynthia, the “Odysseus” of the poem finds the hero entertaining a bevy of “suitors.” She attacks the girls, fumigates the house, and changes the sheets on the bed where they sleep, a cozy loving pair. Although Peter focalizes himself as the epic hero in his odyssey and Clarissa as Helen, a minor character, Clarissa demonstrates herself as the epic hero in her quest as Demeter. Both Helen and Persephone can be said to have been abducted, or possibly they “eloped.” From this point his perspective shapes him as both Joyce’s Ulysses and Homer’s Odysseus while he reminisces about Bourton at the same time. In Euripides’s Helen, she too is abducted by Hermes (the guide to the Underworld) while gathering flowers, like Persephone. Her husband Menelaus rescues her from death (the Egyptian underworld) and returns her to her daughter. This is one of the interlocking structures in this novel“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 91](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=102&annotation=5RTXSDVM))

„74.7/49.30 St Margaret’s: Adjacent to the Abbey, it was built by Edward the Confessor as a parish church; now by tradition, it is the church of the House of Commons where Richard Dalloway works. 74.7-13/49.30-37 hostess-guest motif: Not keeping the departing guest (according to Nestor and Menelaus) is a topos in Odyssey 4.595ff and 15.72, and in Dryden’s All for Love, and Horace’s Satires 1.1.119. It is a custom violated by the Phaiakians in Odyssey 11.333ff. See also Theognis passim and Bram Stoker’s Dracula, the 29 June entry, in the opening narrative in the vampire text that also sucks other texts of their life blood. The frequency of usage of the topos tends to wear it out, and having lost its freshness, its value as a valid speech act is lost. It is more a performance by the narrator than the character’s thought. In Shakespeare’s Troilus and Cressida 3.3.165-169, “Time is like a fashionable host/ That slightly shakes his parting guest by th’ hand/ And with his arms outstretch’d as he would fly,/ Grasps in the comer.” Hostesses are frequent in Proust.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 92](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=103&annotation=ZA3G2WGB))

„74-75/50.10-11 had gone from one to the other and had left, like a bee with honey: The image is of collecting bits of literature such as the text has collected preformed language, a poetic image although we know that bees do not collect honey. The honey bee is frequently a symbol of the Hellenistic poet. See Aristophanes’s comedy Birds 748-751 where the chorus sings, “Whence, like honey-bee from flower/ Phrynichus drank [...] nectar so sweet that its savor/ All his song doth flavor.” The metaphor exploits the analogy between gathering honey and putting a poem together as in Horace Odes 4.2. See Proust 1. 556: “what a vast number of bourgeois calyxes that busy worker [...] could visit. [...] She [a society woman] knew her power of pollination.” The seductive charm of poetry in the Odyssey 10.173 is spoken of as “honeyed words.” See Dover Aristophanes “Frogs” 29. Like the Odyssey, Mrs. Dalloway takes playful delight in manifestations of its own artistry. The voice of song that flows sweeter than honey is the possession of Hesiod’s Muses. In Swift’s Battle of the Books the bee collects both honey and wax providing sweetness and light for the world and a phrase for Matthew Arnold. So much for the buzz on bees. Sorry. 74-78/50-53 Peter manages to leave Clarissa’s door at 11:30 a.m. and it is still 11:30 a.m. when he arrives at Trafalgar Square, and only 11:45 by the time he reaches Regent’s Park as if the occurrence of events were in temporal correlation with reading time. The narrator seems to have neglected to wind the clock; or perhaps Peter, as a pseudo-personification of Time (Chronus), is able to manipulate it himself. As Walker observes, “Clocktime has evidently stood still in these pages.” In Tristram Shandy, clock time is similarly flexible. This is a manifestation of simultaneity and resembles morality plays in which the actor traverses miles in only a moment.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=104&annotation=ZP8MWPHC))

„75. 12/50.21-22 as if rolled down to him [...] his future: The metaphorical un 94 Virginia Woolf ’s Mrs. Dalloway ending task. His future is expressed in the image of Sisyphus whose punishment in the Underworld is to roll his stone perpetually up the hill until it rolls down and he has to start over from the beginning. All of the characters will exhibit a Sisyphean existence. See Homer Odyssey 11.593-98 and Propertius 2.17.7, 2.21.32, and4.11.23. Sisyphus is the classical blabbermouth who offended Zeus and therefore is famous as one of the sinners in the Underworld. Peter cannot be trusted with secrets, a fault to be revealed much later. Having witnessed the abduction of Aegina by Zeus, Sisyphus told her father which made Zeus his enemy thereafter. In order to rescue her he had to bind up Thanatos which meant that no one died until Ares (War) took over. It suggests that Peter may have said something to Old Parry that incurred Richard’s wrath. His repetitive behavior is a good argument for the circular shape of the novel that has much to do with abductions, Helen of Troy being the most famous example. The myth of Sisyphus is considered a solar myth, the sun rising and setting each day. The rolling stone suggests a narrative in a book-roll that reveals itself only by degrees and in proper order.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=104&annotation=TMZ833T8))

This is one of the ways the novel achieves self-definition through containing smaller versions of itself such as a Trojan horse metaphor. The Trojan horse allusion also resumes Peter’s Homeric fantasy. After serving as a metaphor for the novel which contains many literary voices and as a part of Peter’s epic stroll it finally describes one aspect of Mrs. Dalloway and of Clarissa’s character, a form of erotic defamiliarization.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 106](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=117&annotation=4ERJFAAX))

„104.1/68-69 like a drowned sailor: This is Lucretius’s metaphor for a newborn infant in his De rerum natura 5.222-227. It is also a faint allusion to the nautical metaphor. “Found drowned” is a frequent expression in Joyce’s Ulysses, e.g., “Proteus” that includes a citation of a drowned man. See also T. S. Eliot’s Waste Land with its “drowned Phoenician sailor” 1.47 (Wyatt 444). See also the Myth of the Shipwrecked Youth (Kirby Flower Smith 120-157). The image is shared by Odysseus, shipwrecked on the island of the Phaiakians, an image (in turn) of his spiritual rebirth—the Odyssey encompasses a spiritual journey. Such experiences effect the rebirth expected in ritual. Similarly, Peter Walsh dreams in Homeric terms and later actually encounters the “Phaiakians.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 114](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=125&annotation=GUC4PL5A))

„104. 13/69.13 he strained; he pushed: Here Septimus, the baby, the drowned sailor, is giving birth to himself, being reborn and acting as his own midwife, just as Clarissa is her own mother. Birth imagery is a major theme. This self-begetting characteristic is an example of interior duplication of the novel by birthing a smaller version itself. In order to be born again one must die, an event which eliminates the hero from the narrative. Therefore a “double” is required. Gilgamesh had Enkidu, Achilles had Patroclos, Septimus, presumably has Evans. Birth, like rebirth, resembles an initiatory passage through a labyrinth. Most intertextuality is something which the characters fail to credit; Septimus, on the other hand, believes too well. He goes overboard. As the drowned sailor he imitates the birth imagery executed Peter Walsh in his dream, and by Odysseus, an infant washed up naked on the Phaiakian shore where Nausicaa is playing ball (the perfect game?). This is a feedback loop that curves around the autogamous nature of Demeter, a parallel version of that central mythos. Having refused to copulate, Septimus gives birth to himself instead. It is a mystical travail after which the world welcomes the “newborn” (Odyssey 5.394-399). The birth of the hero who has renounced immortality thus demonstrates his ability to get out of tight situations. His nativity is a device like the play-within-the-play device framed by a similar device, the genesis of Mrs. Dalloway. A similar device appears in John Donne’s epic poem, The Progress of the Soule, which gives an account of a self-begetting wolf who is his own sire and dam (line 434). Birth imagery also appears in Between The Acts by way of the snake with a toad in its mouth: “It was birth the wrong way round—a monstrous inversion.” The image is associated with the homosexual William Dodge.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 115](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=126&annotation=MM9RJZBK))

„117.22-23/77.35-36 hurting, thwarting and spoiling human lives: The gods in the Homeric poems are often a petty and a generally frivolous and unreliable lot, the source of comedy. This is an allusion to divine phthonos (envy). The gods punish those whose happiness, success, or good fortune tends to make them “divine.” In the allusion, from the Odyssey 5.118-128, Calypso is complaining for not being able to confer immortality on her love object, the heroic mortal Odysseus. Calypso tells of Demeter who lay with Iasion, only to have him struck down by Zeus’s thunderbolt. In Propertius’s 2.18, Aurora (Dawn) calls the gods unkind because she must leave Tithonus behind while performing her service to the world. She is more joyful that he lives (aged and shrivelled) than sorrowful for the death of Memnon, her son killed at Troy. Clarissa absurdly seems to equate her decorous behavior as a lady with a method of obviating divine jealousy. Preventing the Gods from having it all their way, like Venus mourning Adonis in Ovid’s Metamorphoses 10.700, seems hubristic at least.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 124](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=135&annotation=TG8CDY8N))

„120.22/79.34 a rug for the voyage: The “bon voyage” gifts for Peter’s passage to India (a reference to the novel of E. M. Forster) seem to mark an occasion immediately subsequent to the time when Clarissa refused him. This would have had to be in 1918, some years after the break-up. As in Propertius, “it does not extend to the provision of a convincing chronology” (Wyke “Mistress and Metaphor” 28). A voyage is the conventional Hellenistic cure for love. There is more than one time scheme at work in this novel. This occasion simulates the send-off Calypso gives Odysseus (Odyssey 5.258-268). For more on Calypso see Propertius 1.15.9-14 in Flaschenriem “Speaking of Women” 49-50. Whenever Peter sailed matters not. It relieves Richard of the need to attack Peter since the voyage successfully cuts off his customary free contacts with Clarissa.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 126](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=137&annotation=2EXFFBLF))

„121.12/80.12-13 said it to make him jealous: Daisy is being courted in Peter’s absence by Major Orde and Major Simmons, and her behavior is explicitly like that of Penelope in her “letter” in Ovid’s Heroïdes 1, to make him jealous. The allusion reduces the entire Ithacan episode in the Odyssey to a few words. Daisy plays Penelope to Clarissa’s role as Helen, or even as Calypso who claims the advantage of immortality unlike the homebound wife. Propertius claims that the famous bow of Ulysses “came to life” (3. 13.35) for his disposition of the suitors. Gender reversals have exploited the model of Odysseus as in Propertius 4.8 that casts Cynthia as the Homeric “hero” returned from travel, who banishes her lover’s “suitors” and fumigates the polluted premises before taking him to bed.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 126](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=137&annotation=FNN6LKFR))

„150.9/99.18 divine proportion: This is a term of art. Divine Proportion is also called “the Golden Section” and “the Golden Cut,” referring to the ratio in which a line may be divided into two unequal parts such that the first part relates to the second as the second relates to the whole line (See Glossary) as in Euclid’s Elements 2.11. Presumably, a subject can be correctly rendered in art if the parts are properly related according to this system. It is only one among many theories of art that can be applied to novels and behavior as well. There is nothing magical about it; it is a device that has been long used if only because dividing matters in equal parts may be democratic but dull at the same time; novels so divided are sometimes called “broken-backed.” Different systems express different effects, a matter which art critics were noticing in the Cubist aesthetic among the painters exhibiting in the Paris Salon de “La Section d’Or” that brought Cubism into prominence. Divine proportion is also a geometrical reference to synecdoche, that from the part we can comprehend the whole. Helen’s story (Odyssey 4.239) is an example of the exploits of Odysseus, as mimetic synecdoche. Proportion is not a function of accuracy but rather of suitability. As a criterion for suitable behavior rigidly imposed, the Golden Mean tends to produce paragons of social propriety that are often themselves dull. Whether expressing the beauty of behavior, or painting, or writing, it is best used with moderation like everything else. The vocabulary of Divine Proportion, however, applied even metaphorically to behavior either as science or philosophy is useful as such. Euclid taught at Alexandria ca. 300 bce. Divine proportion implies a controlling style that subordinates its constituent parts, in proportion, to the whole. See the metaphorical “divided line.” in Plato’s Republic 509d-511e. The two parts of the divided line symbolize real things and things that are seen only by the mind. It seems that Bradshaw makes a distinction between reality and things that exist only in Septimus’s mind. Socrates proceeds to discuss his allegory of the cave which extends the significance of the divided line. Shadows in the cave are less real than the objects that cast the shadows, whereas outside the cave in sunlight, reality is of the highest degree. For another perspective of proportion see Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, Book 5. Early Cubist painters, notably among them Juan Gris, used the Golden Section, considered a criterion of beauty, as a basis for design, as a metastatement on “correct proportion” in art monotonously applied. The Salon de “La Section d’Or” was a series 152 Virginia Woolf ’s Mrs. Dalloway of Paris exhibitions from 1909 to 1925, dominated by Cubist painters including Gris. A similar line reappears in the“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 151](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=162&annotation=S77BZPTA))

If Septimus has not already been swallowed by London or killed in combat, it seems that Dr. Bradshaw will finally get him. This also suggests the swooping birds devouring Prometheus’s liver in Aeschylus’s tragedy. Prometheus is the master-craftsman who makes man from leftover bits, like Doctor Frankenstein. Some have thought him the inventor of writing. The name “Prometheus” hides the name of “Theus,” the “Egyptian” god of Socrates’s story, who claims to have invented writing to improve memory (Phaedrus 274 e).“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 154](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=165&annotation=W5TBNH3D))

(“why have so many portraits of generals around?” he asks). The term pedigree has bestial associations. See Juvenal’s Satire 8.132-133 “why not load your pedigree with all those embattled Titans, and Prometheus for good measure?” “[Athena] activates the very presence of heredity on which the aristocratic and patriarchal culture of [the Odyssey] is based” (Murnaghan 66).“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 158](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=169&annotation=FY27XSZK))

It is composed of flexible “modules” (divided and subdivided), structural components corresponding to previous discourse. It imitates “golden section” design as in Juan Gris’s Lavabo. See Camfield. The scenario is reminiscent of the comparable scene in which Odysseus and Penelope each account for events during the hero’s absence (Odyssey 23.301 ff). This repetition is a labyrinthine feature. As in music where the direction demands, da capo, “go back to the beginning,” the narrative now repeats Clarissa’s day from her arrival at home, through Peter’s arrival up to the present. Clarissa and Richard will circle back over the same ground previously traversed. This section serves as a structural turning point for the narrative.

„243.20/160.24-25 their relations to each other are perfect: The Morrises refer back to “Morris” of Clarissa’s youth. Homophrosune, likemindedness, is a characteristic of the royal Phaiakian couple in the Odyssey who live in a kind of earthly paradise (Odyssey 6.181-184; see further Segal Singers 94, 193, and 214). This likemindedness is shared by Clarissa when she later contemplates the suicide. The Homeric motif is a popular device in Propertius and Juvenal. Here the epic hero appears in an elegiac (amorous) context. The Homeric theme relative to Nausicaa is addressed in Joyce’s Ulysses ch. 13. Samuel Butler devotes much time to discussing this scenario, even offering Nausicaa as the Authoress of the Odyssey herself. In Swift’s Battle of the Books, Homer is criticized for describing Nausicaa, a princess, for going to the river to do her brother’s laundry. Here Elaine Morris is training for the family business, perhaps a laundry.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 207](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=218&annotation=K7QQK88J))

„244.7/160.36 They liked him, he felt: Like the Phaiakians (Odyssey 6.276-279 and 7.313), the Morrises almost seem to ponder his suitability as a husband for their daughter Elaine, “young Nausicaa,” as it seems to Peter, a subtle elegiac context for this epic fantasy (See also Propertius 4.8). In Joyce’s Ulysses this Homeric episode is burlesqued in the “Nausicaa” chapter. It is loaded with clichés. This has been a repetition of the substance of Peter’s dream. William Morris published in 1887 a verse translation of the Odyssey. Peter’s version of this part of the Odyssey is analogous to the practice of painters. For example, “Manet borrowed the composition of a detail from Raphael’s Judgement of Paris and entitled it Déjeuner sur l’herbe.” “The audience is presumed to be already familiar with [the original subject matter]” (Dubery and Willats 116).“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 208](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=219&annotation=IFQT8U9I))

„280.8-9/184.8 her dress flamed, her body burnt: See Harrison Prolegomena 409 for ”the primitive Epiphany by fire, an Epiphany not vengeful but beneficent.” This also recalls Cynthia, revenant in a dream with charred dress (her textum) validating her former wish to be cremated, following the poetic commonplace requiring that a poet’s writing be burned (Propertius 4. 7. 8 and 78). Cynthia, like Clarissa, is a text, a written woman. A matrimonial context is suggested in which a Roman bride is dressed in a flameum. Clarissa ironically kindles as she had expected in the morning. It seems that her undivided, androgynous mind has become literally incandescent, luminous and glowing with intense heat (AROO 102). The dress is her burning text. This is the fire of purification that burns away mortality. These are the golden flames of a metaphorical crocus, the saffron used in writing, that thrives with mistreatment, that in order to grow better must die. To kindle a fire is to “beget” a fire. The Hindu marriage service is sanctified by fire. The widow has been subject to suttee in the past. It is “As if the burning shirt of Nessus is upon her” (Antony and Cleopatra 4.10.56). This is imagery appropriate to Miss Havisham’s fiery ordeal in Dickens’s Great Expectations, peace to Peter. A woman burnt alive is featured in Septimus’s hallucination (136). A plagiarist is threatened with burning in Catullus 25. See Creusa who was about to marry Jason until poisoned by a garment given her by Medea who set her body on fire, and she died in torment. Consider also the suicide of Dido on the funeral pyre (Aeneid 4.493-705). Clarissa had said she would “kindle and illuminate” (6). This is a validation of the necessity for attention given to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the Butterfly Effect). Here lust, life, and heat all suggest an impending birth/rebirth. Several metaphorical domains unite. The fire thus “kindled” is menos (vitality), the functioning principle of life and the antidote (pharmakon) for death. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (lines 101-276) the goddess, disguised as an old woman, a nurse, attempts to immortalize young Demophoon by roasting him in the menos of fire; he “blooms” until his mother sees what is happening and rescues her son, thwarting Demeter’s attempt to burn away his mortality. Demeter then sloughs off old age, her own appearances of mortality, identifies herself, and manifests the youthful beauty of the goddess that she is. The change illustrates the concept of two persons yet but one goddess, the mother and maid (Harrison Prolegomena 562). Like the moment of Septimus’s death, this is also a great literary moment in the novel—literally Clarissa’s epiphany. Clarissa is successful where Demeter is not. Both Clarissa and her double will transcend The Annotations 229 death, achieve immortality, by going back to the beginning. Similarly, Odysseus buries himself in a heap of leaves as one might bury a burning log in a heap of ashes to preserve the seed of fire (Odyssey 5. 488-491). Athanassakis cites Apollodorus for the parallel myth in which Thetis hid Achilles in fire in her attempt to burn away his mortal parts. The episode corresponds to the kind of epiphany described in Peter’s dream; Clarissa is “taken by surprise with a moment of extraordinary exaltation” (85) and absorbed in a timeless passionate state of contemplation and communion according to G. E. Moore. The veil of obscurity is lifted. Instead of seeing through a glass darkly, she sees face to face. It is a moment of vision.“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 228](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=239&annotation=XTBGKZB8))

„281.3/184.27-28 there was an embrace in death: The coup de foudre is stunning. Thus far, it seems merely a “purely masculine orgy,” (AROO 106). This is in contradiction to Marvell’s seduction poem, “To His Coy Mistress,” his macabre reminder that “the grave’s a fine and private place, but none, I think, do there embrace.” The embrace suggests Odyseus’s threefold attempted embrace of his mother in the Underworld (Odyssey 11.205). Yet, embrace also serves as a euphemism for sex, the marital embrace that the Greeks associate with marriage in imagery and ritual. See Adams 181-182 on Tibullus 2.6.52, Propertius 1.13.19 and 2.15.2. Philology recapitulates biology. Initiation rites focus on sex. In a union of discourse she has executed a sacred marriage, an Eleusinian blend (Harrison Prolegomena 554).“ ([Hoff, 2018, p. 230](zotero://select/library/items/25QMRYDR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNDAGMJQ?page=241&annotation=2WCZKR3R))

„282.14/185.25-26 Nothing could be slow enough; nothing last too long: Propertius 1.19.26 similarly extends his erotic pleasures. Penelope also can hold back the night for extending conjugal leisure with her newly returned husband, the hero who has just come back (Odyssey 23.241-246). See Murnaghan 73. In Plautus’s Amphitryo the night of Heracles’s mother’s labor is similarly deliberately extended as told in Propertius 2.22.25.

„Homer’s Odyssey with its temporal to-ing and fro-ing and jumping from island to island is, like Mrs. Dalloway, “elaborately nonlinear” (Slatkin “Odyssey” 224).

The Odyssey and Mrs. Dalloway, both, treat “narrative or narrative discourse as a subject in itself ” (Slatkin 229) with the act of narrating of proleptic references and flashbacks a fantastic feature of the discourse. Temporal location of the action is one of Mrs. Dalloway’s most labyrinthine structures.

## The Pseudo Homeric World (Molly Hoff)


### Overall Structure and Purpose

    Elegiacization approach: "When Homer's Odyssey is incorporated into Mrs. Dalloway, several things are accomplished. One is the blending of Homer's narrative with 'the style, character and values appropriate to Roman elegy'" (p.189)
    Working title significance: "'The Hours,' strongly suggests Homer's Odyssey... 'The whole Odyssey is a revelation in hexameters of the moral, physical, social, and cosmic dimensions of hora [timeliness]'" (p.188)

### Character Parallels

    Peter Walsh/Odysseus: "Peter Walsh, like Odysseus, tells the stories of his past by flashback during and as a part of the story of his 'odyssean' present" (p.195)
    Clarissa's multiple roles: "Clarissa's persona as Helen has been planted in Peter's mind by none other than Sally Seton" (p.196)
    Miss Kilman/Scylla and Charybdis: "This pair of qualities suggests her relationship to the Odyssean pair, Scylla and Charybdis" (p.190)
    Sally/Phaiakians: "Having five sons identifies her as an allomorph of the Phaiakian queen, Arete of Scheria" (p.201)

### Specific Episode References

    Drawing room scene: "It begins in Clarissa's drawing room, simulating Odysseus's visit in Helen's chamber when he reveals the Greek strategy" (p.195)
    Party scene: "The party seems to be falling flat, when Clarissa like a good hostess merely wants everyone to be themselves and have a good time" (p.200)
    Viewing of guests: "Peter and Sally together recreate the Teichoscopia from Iliad 3.166 ff." (p.200)

### How Woolf Uses Intertextuality

### Transformation Techniques

    "Propertius consciously criticizes Homeric plot, character, and ethical ideals; and consequently, while writing poetry, also engages in what today would be called 'literary criticism'" (p.190)
    "The necessary absurdities that are manifest in this parody reflect the fact that Virginia Woolf's reading of Ulysses was not a sympathetic one" (p.202)

### Layering Methods

    "Mrs. Dalloway tracks Homer across London—the most primitive literary track—a fact revealing that, for some, Homeric expertise may be limited to Joyce's novel. Virgil, Shakespeare, and Dickens (who like Dante 'knew how to pillage right and left') are a few who follow the same routes in this cento that makes something new out of what already exists" (p.188)

### Structural Approaches

    "The novel's surface simplicity, like that of the Odyssey, 'disguises the depth of its thoughts'" (p.194)
    "For Peter, this elite culture simulates Scherian culture and recapitulates the end of his day in London... a story that like the Odyssey moves in a textual circle" (p.201)

    Techniques for Spotting References: "It is 'revealing to those who know the original, but hermetic to the uninitiated,' and it 'can only hope to appeal to a highly educated and critically perceptive minority'" (p.202)

    The article emphasizes that Woolf's intertextual approach is highly sophisticated:
    "Its staples are indirection, preterition, disguise, subterfuge, and guile; it is demanding yet enriching while giving the reader 'an ever-increasing responsibility to share the work of creation'" (p.202)

The article concludes that Mrs. Dalloway is:
"a fiction critical of Joyce's Ulysses, like Ulysses it is constructed from and mirrors classical literature... it shows that a brief but coherent narrative can parody just as much as a long one and can be equally as obscure without being totally unintelligible" (p.202)
