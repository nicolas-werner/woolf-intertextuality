"Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself. For Lucy had her work cut out for her. The doors would be taken
off their hinges; Rumpelmayer's men were coming. And then, thought
Clarissa Dalloway, what a morning--fresh as if issued to children
on a beach. What a lark! What a plunge! For so it had always seemed to her,
when, with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now,
she had burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into
the open air. How fresh, how calm, stiller than this of course,
the air was in the early morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss
of a wave; chill and sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she
then was) solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at the open
window, that something awful was about to happen; looking at the
flowers, at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks
rising, falling; standing and looking until Peter Walsh said,
""Musing among the vegetables?""--was that it?--""I prefer men to
cauliflowers""--was that it? He must have said it at breakfast one
morning when she had gone out on to the terrace--Peter Walsh. He
would be back from India one of these days, June or July, she
forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull; it was his sayings
one remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his
grumpiness and, when millions of things had utterly vanished--how
strange it was!--a few sayings like this about cabbages. She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall's van to
pass. A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as
one does know people who live next door to one in Westminster); a
touch of the bird about her, of the jay, blue-green, light,
vivacious, though she was over fifty, and grown very white since
her illness."," If the lordly wooers shall slay me by
guile in the halls, and divide among them the heritage of my father,
then I should wish thee to keep and enjoy the gifts thyself, rather
than any of these. But if I shall sow the seeds of death and fate for
the wooers, then gladly bring me to the house the gifts that I will
gladly take.” Therewith he led the travel-worn stranger to the house. Now when they
came to the fair-lying palace, they laid aside their mantles on the
chairs and high seats, and went to the polished baths, and bathed them.
So when the maidens had bathed them and anointed them with olive oil,
and cast about them thick mantles and doublets, they came forth from
the baths, and sat upon the seats. Then the handmaid bare water for the
hands in a goodly golden ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin
to wash withal, and drew to their side a polished table. And the grave
dame bare wheaten bread, and set it by them, and laid on the board many
dainties, giving freely of such things as she had by her. And the
mother of Telemachus sat over against him by the pillar of the hall,
leaning against a chair, and spinning the slender threads from the
yarn. And they stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer set
before them. Now when they had put from them the desire of meat and
drink, the wise Penelope first spake among them: “Telemachus, verily I will go up to my upper chamber, and lay me in my
bed, the place of my groanings, that is ever watered by my tears, since

who straightway marvelled on the dream, and went through the halls to
tell her parents, her father dear and her mother. And she found them
within, her mother sitting by the hearth with the women her handmaids,
spinning yarn of sea-purple stain, but her father she met as he was
going forth to the renowned kings in their council, whither the noble
Phaeacians called him. Standing close by her dear father she spake,
saying: “Father, dear, couldst thou not lend me a high waggon with
strong wheels, that I may take the goodly raiment to the river to wash,
so much as I have lying soiled? Yea and it is seemly that thou thyself,
when thou art with the princes in council, shouldest have fresh raiment
to wear. Also, there are five dear sons of thine in the halls, two
married, but three are lusty bachelors, and these are always eager for
new-washen garments wherein to go to the dances; for all these things
have I taken thought.” This she said, because she was ashamed to speak of glad marriage to her
father; but he saw all and answered, saying: “Neither the mules nor aught else do I grudge thee, my child. Go thy
ways, and the thralls shall get thee ready a high waggon with good
wheels, and fitted with an upper frame.” Therewith he called to his men, and they gave ear, and without the
palace they made ready the smooth-running mule-wain, and led the mules
beneath the yoke, and harnessed them under the car, while the maiden
brought forth from her bower the shining raiment. This she stored in
the polished car, and her mother filled a basket with all manner of
food to the heart’s desire, dainties too she set therein, and she
poured wine into a goat-skin bottle, while Nausicaa climbed into the
wain. And her mother gave her soft olive oil also in a golden cruse,
that she and her maidens might anoint themselves after the bath. Then
Nausicaa took the whip and the shining reins, and touched the mules to
start them; then there was a clatter of hoofs, and on they strained
without flagging, with their load of the raiment and the maiden.",BOOK VI.,0.7220677384820512,True,medium,"Both passages involve female characters engaging in domestic activities that are imbued with a sense of personal agency and anticipation.

had now come to the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the well-builded
roof, holding her glistening tire before her face, and on either side
of her stood a faithful handmaid. And straightway the knees of the
wooers were loosened, and their hearts were enchanted with love, and
each one uttered a prayer that he might be her bed-fellow. But she
spake to Telemachus, her dear son: “Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer stable as they
were. While thou wast still a child, thou hadst a yet quicker and more
crafty wit, but now that thou art great of growth, and art come to the
measure of manhood, and a stranger looking to thy stature and thy
beauty might say that thou must be some rich man’s son, thy mind and
thy thoughts are no longer right as of old. For lo, what manner of deed
has been done in these halls, in that thou hast suffered thy guest to
be thus shamefully dealt with. How would it be now, if the stranger
sitting thus in our house, were to come to some harm all through this
evil handling? Shame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mother mine, as to this matter I
count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have I knowledge and
understanding of each thing, of the good and of the evil; but
heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I cannot devise all things according
to wisdom, for these men in their evil counsel drive me from my wits,
on this side and on that, and there is none to aid me. Howsoever this
battle between Irus and the stranger did not fall out as the wooers
would have had it, but the stranger proved the better man.",BOOK XVIII.,0.7198219367790334,True,medium,"Both passages involve a central female figure who is reflecting on past events and relationships.

fire beneath the mighty cauldron. So the water waxed warm; but when it
boiled in the bright brazen vessel, she set me in a bath and bathed me
with water from out a great cauldron, pouring it over head and
shoulders, when she had mixed it to a pleasant warmth, till from my
limbs she took away the consuming weariness. Now after she had bathed
me and anointed me well with olive oil, and cast about me a fair mantle
and a doublet, she led me into the halls and set me on a chair with
studs of silver, a goodly carven chair, and beneath was a footstool for
the feet. And a handmaid bare water for the hands in a goodly golden
ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin to wash withal; and to my
side she drew a polished table, and a grave dame bare wheaten bread and
set it by me, and laid on the board many dainties, giving freely of
such things as she had by her. And she bade me eat, but my soul found
no pleasure therein. I sat with other thoughts, and my heart had a
boding of ill. “Now when Circe saw that I sat thus, and that I put not forth my hands
to the meat, and that I was mightily afflicted, she drew near to me and
spake to me winged words: “‘Wherefore thus, Odysseus, dost thou sit there like a speechless man,
consuming thine own soul, and dost not touch meat nor drink? Dost thou
indeed deem there is some further guile? Nay, thou hast no cause to
fear, for already I have sworn thee a strong oath not to harm thee.’ “So spake she, but I answered her, saying: ‘Oh, Circe, what righteous
man would have the heart to taste meat and drink ere he had redeemed
his company, and beheld them face to face? But if in good faith thou
biddest me eat and drink, then let them go free, that mine eyes may
behold my dear companions.’ “So I spake, and Circe passed out through the hall with the wand in her
hand, and opened the doors of the stye, and drave them forth in the
shape of swine of nine seasons old. There they stood before her, and
she went through their midst, and anointed each one of them with
another charm.",BOOK X.,0.7192132971202971,True,medium,"Both passages involve a character reflecting on past experiences and the anticipation of future events.

the stranger, yea he shall not henceforth profit himself here, for all
his sore anger. For how shalt thou learn concerning me, stranger,
whether indeed I excel all women in wit and thrifty device, if all
unkempt and evil clad thou sittest at supper in my halls? Man’s life is
brief enough! And if any be a hard man and hard at heart, all men cry
evil on him for the time to come, while yet he lives, and all men mock
him when he is dead. But if any be a blameless man and blameless of
heart, his guests spread abroad his fame over the whole earth and many
people call him noble.” Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said: “O wife revered
of Odysseus, son of Laertes, mantles verily and shining blankets are
hateful to me, since first I left behind me the snowy hills of Crete,
voyaging in the long-oared galley; nay, I will lie as in time past I
was used to rest through the sleepless nights. For full many a night I
have lain on an unsightly bed, and awaited the bright throned Dawn. And
baths for the feet are no longer my delight, nor shall any women of
those who are serving maidens in thy house touch my foot, unless there
chance to be some old wife, true of heart, one that has borne as much
trouble as myself; I would not grudge such an one to touch my feet.” Then wise Penelope answered him: “Dear stranger, for never yet has
there come to my house, of strangers from afar, a dearer man or so
discreet as thou, uttering so heedfully the words of wisdom. I have an
ancient woman of an understanding heart, that diligently nursed and
tended that hapless man my lord, she took him in her arms in the hour

to them their garments. Then let the divine minstrel, with his loud
lyre in hand, lead off for us the measure of the mirthful dance. So

these things out of a friendly heart, as a father to his son, and never
will I forget them. But now I pray thee abide here, though eager to be
gone, to the end that after thou hast bathed and had all thy heart’s
desire, thou mayest wend to the ship joyful in spirit, with a costly
gift and very goodly, to be an heirloom of my giving, such as dear
friends give to friends.” Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: “Hold me now no
longer, that am eager for the way. But whatsoever gift thine heart
shall bid thee give me, when I am on my way back let it be mine to
carry home: bear from thy stores a gift right goodly, and it shall
bring thee the worth thereof in return.” So spake she and departed, the grey-eyed Athene, and like an eagle of
the sea she flew away, but in his spirit she planted might and courage,
and put him in mind of his father yet more than heretofore. And he
marked the thing and was amazed, for he deemed that it was a god; and
anon he went among the wooers, a godlike man. Now the renowned minstrel was singing to the wooers, and they sat
listening in silence; and his song was of the pitiful return of the
Achaeans, that Pallas Athene laid on them as they came forth from Troy.
And from her upper chamber the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope,
caught the glorious strain, and she went down the high stairs from her
chamber, not alone, for two of her handmaids bare her company. Now when
the fair lady had come unto the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the
well-builded roof holding up her glistening tire before her face; and a
faithful maiden stood on either side her. Then she fell a weeping, and
spake unto the divine minstrel: “Phemius, since thou knowest many other charms for mortals, deeds of
men and gods, which bards rehearse, some one of these do thou sing as
thou sittest by them, and let them drink their wine in silence; but

indeed thou art a goddess of them that keep the wide heaven; to
Artemis, then, the daughter of great Zeus, I mainly liken thee, for
beauty and stature and shapeliness. But if thou art one of the

thy lady mother, and thrice blessed thy brethren. Surely their souls
ever glow with gladness for thy sake, each time they see thee entering
the dance, so fair a flower of maidens. But he is of heart the most
blessed beyond all other who shall prevail with gifts of wooing, and
lead thee to his home. Never have mine eyes beheld such an one among
mortals, neither man nor woman; great awe comes upon me as I look on
thee. Yet in Delos once I saw as goodly a thing: a young sapling of a
palm tree springing by the altar of Apollo. For thither too I went, and
much people with me, on that path where my sore troubles were to be.
Yea, and when I looked thereupon, long time I marvelled in spirit,—for
never grew there yet so goodly a shoot from ground,—even in such wise
as I wonder at thee, lady, and am astonied and do greatly fear to touch
thy knees, though grievous sorrow is upon me. Yesterday, on the
twentieth day, I escaped from the wine-dark deep, but all that time
continually the wave bare me, and the vehement winds drave, from the

the oars upon the benches, step all a shore, and thereafter come to our

all. To the noble youths I give this commandment; but ye others,

stranger in the halls, and let no man make excuse. Moreover, bid hither
the divine minstrel, Demodocus, for the god hath given minstrelsy to
him as to none other, to make men glad in what way soever his spirit
stirs him to sing.” He spake and led the way, and the sceptred kings accompanied him, while
the henchmen went for the divine minstrel. And chosen youths, fifty and
two, departed at his command, to the shore of the unharvested sea. But

" For it was the middle of June. The War was over, except for some
one like Mrs. Foxcroft at the Embassy last night eating her heart
out because that nice boy was killed and now the old Manor House
must go to a cousin; or Lady Bexborough who opened a bazaar, they
said, with the telegram in her hand, John, her favourite, killed;
but it was over; thank Heaven--over. It was June. The King and
Queen were at the Palace. And everywhere, though it was still so
early, there was a beating, a stirring of galloping ponies, tapping
of cricket bats; Lords, Ascot, Ranelagh and all the rest of it;
wrapped in the soft mesh of the grey-blue morning air, which, as

Now the wooers turned them to the dance and the delightsome song, and
made merry, and waited till evening should come on. And as they made
merry, dusk evening came upon them. Then they went each one to his own
house to lie down to rest. But Telemachus, where his chamber was builded high up in the fair
court, in a place with wide prospect, thither betook him to his bed,
pondering many thoughts in his mind; and with him went trusty
Eurycleia, and bare for him torches burning. She was the daughter of
Ops, son of Peisenor, and Laertes bought her on a time with his wealth,
while as yet she was in her first youth, and gave for her the worth of
twenty oxen. And he honoured her even as he honoured his dear wife in
the halls, but he never lay with her, for he shunned the wrath of his
lady. She went with Telemachus and bare for him the burning torches:
and of all the women of the household she loved him most, and she had
nursed him when a little one. Then he opened the doors of the
well-builded chamber and sat him on the bed and took off his soft
doublet, and put it in the wise old woman’s hands. So she folded the
doublet and smoothed it, and hung it on a pin by the jointed bedstead,
and went forth on her way from the room, and pulled to the door with
the silver handle, and drew home the bar with the thong. There, all

had now come to the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the well-builded
roof, holding her glistening tire before her face, and on either side
of her stood a faithful handmaid. And straightway the knees of the
wooers were loosened, and their hearts were enchanted with love, and
each one uttered a prayer that he might be her bed-fellow. But she
spake to Telemachus, her dear son: “Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer stable as they
were. While thou wast still a child, thou hadst a yet quicker and more
crafty wit, but now that thou art great of growth, and art come to the
measure of manhood, and a stranger looking to thy stature and thy
beauty might say that thou must be some rich man’s son, thy mind and
thy thoughts are no longer right as of old. For lo, what manner of deed
has been done in these halls, in that thou hast suffered thy guest to
be thus shamefully dealt with. How would it be now, if the stranger
sitting thus in our house, were to come to some harm all through this
evil handling? Shame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mother mine, as to this matter I
count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have I knowledge and
understanding of each thing, of the good and of the evil; but
heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I cannot devise all things according
to wisdom, for these men in their evil counsel drive me from my wits,

was left behind in the hall, devising with Athene’s aid the slaying of
the wooers. Now forth from her chamber came the wise Penelope, like Artemis or
golden Aphrodite, and they set a chair for her hard by before the fire,
where she was wont to sit, a chair well-wrought and inlaid with ivory
and silver, which on a time the craftsman Icmalius had fashioned, and
had joined thereto a footstool, that was part of the chair, whereon a
great fleece was used to be laid. Here then, the wise Penelope sat her
down, and next came white-armed handmaids from the women’s chamber, and
began to take away the many fragments of food, and the tables and the
cups whence the proud lords had been drinking, and they raked out the
fire from the braziers on to the floor, and piled many fresh logs upon
them, to give light and warmth. Then Melantho began to revile Odysseus yet a second time, saying:
“Stranger, wilt thou still be a plague to us here, circling round the
house in the night, and spying the women? Nay, get thee forth, thou
wretched thing, and be thankful for thy supper, or straightway shalt
thou even be smitten with a torch and so fare out of the doors.” Then Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on her, and said: “Good
woman, what possesses thee to assail me thus out of an angry heart? Is
it because I go filthy and am clothed about in sorry raiment, and beg
through the land, for necessity is laid on me? This is the manner of
beggars and of wandering men. For I too once had a house of mine own
among men, a rich man with a wealthy house, and many a time would I
give to a wanderer, what manner of man soever he might be, and in
whatsoever need he came. And I had countless thralls, and all else in
plenty, whereby folk live well and have a name for riches. But Zeus,
the son of Cronos, made me desolate of all, for surely it was his will.
Wherefore, woman, see lest some day thou too lose all thy fine show
wherein thou now excellest among the handmaids, as well may chance, if
thy mistress be provoked to anger with thee, or if Odysseus come home,
for there is yet a place for hope. And even if he hath perished as ye
deem, and is never more to return, yet by Apollo’s grace he hath a son
like him, Telemachus, and none of the women works wantonness in his
halls without his knowledge, for he is no longer of an age not to mark
it, Thus he spake, and the wise Penelope heard him, and rebuked the
handmaid, and spake and hailed her: “Thou reckless thing and unabashed, be sure thy great sin is not hidden
from me, and thy blood shall be on thine own head for the same! Four
thou knewest right well, in that thou hadst heard it from my lips, how

And it shall be the worse for any hurtful man of the wooers, that vexes
the stranger, yea he shall not henceforth profit himself here, for all
his sore anger. For how shalt thou learn concerning me, stranger,
whether indeed I excel all women in wit and thrifty device, if all
unkempt and evil clad thou sittest at supper in my halls? Man’s life is

did it, without a word; he was really unselfish, and as for saying,
as Peter did, that he had no heart, no brain, nothing but the
manners and breeding of an English gentleman, that was only her
dear Peter at his worst; and he could be intolerable; he could be
impossible; but adorable to walk with on a morning like this. (June had drawn out every leaf on the trees."," Hard of heart was
she, nor had she courage to keep the great house of her wedded lord
continually till his coming.” Even so men spake, and knew not how these things were ordained.
Meanwhile, the house-dame Eurynome had bathed the great-hearted
Odysseus within his house, and anointed him with olive-oil, and cast
about him a goodly mantle and a doublet. Moreover Athene shed great
beauty from his head downwards, and made him greater and more mighty to
behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the
hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon
silver, one that Hephaestus and Pallas Athene have taught all manner of
craft, and full of grace is his handiwork, even so did Athene shed
grace about his head and shoulders, and forth from the bath he came, in
form like to the immortals. Then he sat down again on the high seat,
whence he had arisen, over against his wife, and spake to her, saying: “Strange lady, surely to thee above all womankind the Olympians have
given a heart that cannot be softened. No other woman in the world
would harden her heart to stand thus aloof from her husband, who after
much travail and sore had come to her, in the twentieth year, to his
own country. Nay come, nurse, strew a bed for me to lie all alone, for
assuredly her spirit within her is as iron.” Then wise Penelope answered him again: “Strange man, I have no proud
thoughts nor do I think scorn of thee, nor am I too greatly astonied,
but I know right well what manner of man thou wert, when thou wentest
forth out of Ithaca, on the long-oared galley. But come, Eurycleia,

plenteous store, bread and sweet wine, and she clad me in imperishable
raiment, and sent forth a warm and gentle wind to blow. For ten days
and seven I sailed, traversing the deep, and on the eighteenth day the
shadowy hills of your land showed in sight, and my heart was
glad,—wretched that I was—for surely I was still to be the mate of much
sorrow. For Poseidon, shaker of the earth, stirred up the same, who
roused against me the winds and stopped my way, and made a wondrous sea
to swell, nor did the wave suffer me to be borne upon my raft, as I
made ceaseless moan. Thus the storm winds shattered the raft, but as
for me I cleft my way through the gulf yonder, till the wind bare and
the water brought me nigh your coast. Then as I strove to land upon the
shore, the wave had overwhelmed me, dashing me against the great rocks
and a desolate place, but at length I gave way and swam back, till I
came to the river, where the place seemed best in mine eyes, smooth of
rocks, and withal there was a shelter from the wind. And as I came out
I sank down, gathering to me my spirit, and immortal night came on.
Then I gat me forth and away from the heaven-fed river, and laid me to
sleep in the bushes and strewed leaves about me, and the god shed over
me infinite sleep. There among the leaves I slept, stricken at heart,
all the night long, even till the morning and mid-day. And the sun sank

indeed thou art a goddess of them that keep the wide heaven; to
Artemis, then, the daughter of great Zeus, I mainly liken thee, for
beauty and stature and shapeliness. But if thou art one of the
daughters of men who dwell on earth, thrice blessed are thy father and
thy lady mother, and thrice blessed thy brethren. Surely their souls
ever glow with gladness for thy sake, each time they see thee entering
the dance, so fair a flower of maidens. But he is of heart the most
blessed beyond all other who shall prevail with gifts of wooing, and
lead thee to his home. Never have mine eyes beheld such an one among
mortals, neither man nor woman; great awe comes upon me as I look on
thee. Yet in Delos once I saw as goodly a thing: a young sapling of a
palm tree springing by the altar of Apollo. For thither too I went, and
much people with me, on that path where my sore troubles were to be.
Yea, and when I looked thereupon, long time I marvelled in spirit,—for
never grew there yet so goodly a shoot from ground,—even in such wise
as I wonder at thee, lady, and am astonied and do greatly fear to touch
thy knees, though grievous sorrow is upon me. Yesterday, on the
twentieth day, I escaped from the wine-dark deep, but all that time
continually the wave bare me, and the vehement winds drave, from the
isle Ogygia. And now some god has cast me on this shore, that here too,

isle, he went forth from the sea of violet blue to get him up into the
land, till he came to a great cave, wherein dwelt the nymph of the
braided tresses: and he found her within. And on the hearth there was a
great fire burning, and from afar through the isle was smelt the
fragrance of cleft cedar blazing, and of sandal wood. And the nymph
within was singing with a sweet voice as she fared to and fro before
the loom, and wove with a shuttle of gold. And round about the cave
there was a wood blossoming, alder and poplar and sweet-smelling
cypress. And therein roosted birds long of wing, owls and falcons and
chattering sea-crows, which have their business in the waters. And lo,
there about the hollow cave trailed a gadding garden vine, all rich
with clusters. And fountains four set orderly were running with clear
water, hard by one another, turned each to his own course. And all
around soft meadows bloomed of violets and parsley, yea, even a
deathless god who came thither might wonder at the sight and be glad at
heart. There the messenger, the slayer of Argos, stood and wondered.
Now when he had gazed at all with wonder, anon he went into the wide

these things out of a friendly heart, as a father to his son, and never
will I forget them. But now I pray thee abide here, though eager to be
gone, to the end that after thou hast bathed and had all thy heart’s
desire, thou mayest wend to the ship joyful in spirit, with a costly
gift and very goodly, to be an heirloom of my giving, such as dear
friends give to friends.” Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: “Hold me now no
longer, that am eager for the way. But whatsoever gift thine heart
shall bid thee give me, when I am on my way back let it be mine to
carry home: bear from thy stores a gift right goodly, and it shall
bring thee the worth thereof in return.” So spake she and departed, the grey-eyed Athene, and like an eagle of
the sea she flew away, but in his spirit she planted might and courage,
and put him in mind of his father yet more than heretofore. And he
marked the thing and was amazed, for he deemed that it was a god; and
anon he went among the wooers, a godlike man. Now the renowned minstrel was singing to the wooers, and they sat
listening in silence; and his song was of the pitiful return of the
Achaeans, that Pallas Athene laid on them as they came forth from Troy.
And from her upper chamber the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope,
caught the glorious strain, and she went down the high stairs from her
chamber, not alone, for two of her handmaids bare her company. Now when
the fair lady had come unto the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the
well-builded roof holding up her glistening tire before her face; and a
faithful maiden stood on either side her. Then she fell a weeping, and
spake unto the divine minstrel: “Phemius, since thou knowest many other charms for mortals, deeds of
men and gods, which bards rehearse, some one of these do thou sing as
thou sittest by them, and let them drink their wine in silence; but

Now the wooers turned them to the dance and the delightsome song, and
made merry, and waited till evening should come on. And as they made
merry, dusk evening came upon them. Then they went each one to his own
house to lie down to rest. But Telemachus, where his chamber was builded high up in the fair
court, in a place with wide prospect, thither betook him to his bed,
pondering many thoughts in his mind; and with him went trusty
Eurycleia, and bare for him torches burning. She was the daughter of
Ops, son of Peisenor, and Laertes bought her on a time with his wealth,
while as yet she was in her first youth, and gave for her the worth of
twenty oxen. And he honoured her even as he honoured his dear wife in
the halls, but he never lay with her, for he shunned the wrath of his
lady. She went with Telemachus and bare for him the burning torches:
and of all the women of the household she loved him most, and she had
nursed him when a little one. Then he opened the doors of the
well-builded chamber and sat him on the bed and took off his soft
doublet, and put it in the wise old woman’s hands. So she folded the
doublet and smoothed it, and hung it on a pin by the jointed bedstead,
and went forth on her way from the room, and pulled to the door with
the silver handle, and drew home the bar with the thong. There, all

day time she would weave the mighty web, and in the night unravel the
same, when she had let place the torches by her. Thus for the space of
three years she hid the thing by craft and beguiled the minds of the
Achaeans; but when the fourth year arrived and the seasons came round,
then at the last one of her women who knew all declared it, and we
found her unravelling the splendid web. Thus she finished it perforce
and sore against her will. But as for thee, the wooers make thee answer
thus, that thou mayest know it in thine own heart, thou and all the
Achaeans! Send away thy mother, and bid her be married to whomsoever
her father commands, and whoso is well pleasing unto her. But if she
will continue for long to vex the sons of the Achaeans, pondering in
her heart those things that Athene hath given her beyond women,
knowledge of all fair handiwork, yea, and cunning wit, and wiles—so be
it! Such wiles as hers we have never yet heard that any even of the
women of old did know, of those that aforetime were fair-tressed
Achaean ladies, Tyro, and Alcmene, and Mycene with the bright crown.
Not one of these in the imaginations of their hearts was like unto
Penelope, yet herein at least her imagining was not good. For in
despite of her the wooers will devour thy living and thy substance, so
long as she is steadfast in such purpose as the gods now put within her

Odysseus within his house, and anointed him with olive-oil, and cast
about him a goodly mantle and a doublet. Moreover Athene shed great
beauty from his head downwards, and made him greater and more mighty to
behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like the
hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays gold upon
silver, one that Hephaestus and Pallas Athene have taught all manner of

Melantho chid him shamefully, Melantho that Dolius begat, but Penelope
reared, and entreated her tenderly as she had been her own child, and
gave her playthings to her heart’s desire. Yet, for all that, sorrow
for Penelope touched not her heart, but she loved Eurymachus and was
his paramour. Now she chid Odysseus with railing words: “Wretched guest, surely thou art some brain-struck man, seeing that
thou dost not choose to go and sleep at a smithy, or at some place of
common resort, but here thou pratest much and boldly among many lords
and hast no fear at heart. Verily wine has got about thy wits, or

Art thou beside thyself for joy, because thou hast beaten the beggar
Irus? Take heed lest a better man than Irus rise up presently against
thee, to lay his mighty hands about thy head and bedabble thee with
blood, and send thee hence from the house.” Then Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on her, and said: “Yea,
straight will I go yonder and tell Telemachus hereof, thou shameless
thing, for this thy speech, that forthwith he may cut thee limb from
limb.” So he spake, and with his saying scared away the women, who fled
through the hall, and the knees of each were loosened for fear, for

each one uttered a prayer that he might be her bed-fellow. But she
spake to Telemachus, her dear son: “Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer stable as they
were. While thou wast still a child, thou hadst a yet quicker and more
crafty wit, but now that thou art great of growth, and art come to the
measure of manhood, and a stranger looking to thy stature and thy
beauty might say that thou must be some rich man’s son, thy mind and
thy thoughts are no longer right as of old. For lo, what manner of deed
has been done in these halls, in that thou hast suffered thy guest to
be thus shamefully dealt with. How would it be now, if the stranger
sitting thus in our house, were to come to some harm all through this
evil handling? Shame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mother mine, as to this matter I
count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have I knowledge and
understanding of each thing, of the good and of the evil; but
heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I cannot devise all things according
to wisdom, for these men in their evil counsel drive me from my wits,

was left behind in the hall, devising with Athene’s aid the slaying of
the wooers. Now forth from her chamber came the wise Penelope, like Artemis or
golden Aphrodite, and they set a chair for her hard by before the fire,
where she was wont to sit, a chair well-wrought and inlaid with ivory
and silver, which on a time the craftsman Icmalius had fashioned, and
had joined thereto a footstool, that was part of the chair, whereon a
great fleece was used to be laid. Here then, the wise Penelope sat her
down, and next came white-armed handmaids from the women’s chamber, and
began to take away the many fragments of food, and the tables and the
cups whence the proud lords had been drinking, and they raked out the
fire from the braziers on to the floor, and piled many fresh logs upon
them, to give light and warmth. Then Melantho began to revile Odysseus yet a second time, saying:
“Stranger, wilt thou still be a plague to us here, circling round the
house in the night, and spying the women? Nay, get thee forth, thou
wretched thing, and be thankful for thy supper, or straightway shalt
thou even be smitten with a torch and so fare out of the doors.” Then Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on her, and said: “Good
woman, what possesses thee to assail me thus out of an angry heart? Is
it because I go filthy and am clothed about in sorry raiment, and beg
through the land, for necessity is laid on me? This is the manner of
beggars and of wandering men. For I too once had a house of mine own
among men, a rich man with a wealthy house, and many a time would I
give to a wanderer, what manner of man soever he might be, and in
whatsoever need he came. And I had countless thralls, and all else in
plenty, whereby folk live well and have a name for riches. But Zeus,
the son of Cronos, made me desolate of all, for surely it was his will.
Wherefore, woman, see lest some day thou too lose all thy fine show
wherein thou now excellest among the handmaids, as well may chance, if
thy mistress be provoked to anger with thee, or if Odysseus come home,
for there is yet a place for hope. And even if he hath perished as ye
deem, and is never more to return, yet by Apollo’s grace he hath a son
like him, Telemachus, and none of the women works wantonness in his
halls without his knowledge, for he is no longer of an age not to mark
it, Thus he spake, and the wise Penelope heard him, and rebuked the
handmaid, and spake and hailed her: “Thou reckless thing and unabashed, be sure thy great sin is not hidden
from me, and thy blood shall be on thine own head for the same! Four
thou knewest right well, in that thou hadst heard it from my lips, how

plenteous store, bread and sweet wine, and she clad me in imperishable
raiment, and sent forth a warm and gentle wind to blow. For ten days
and seven I sailed, traversing the deep, and on the eighteenth day the
shadowy hills of your land showed in sight, and my heart was
glad,—wretched that I was—for surely I was still to be the mate of much
sorrow. For Poseidon, shaker of the earth, stirred up the same, who
roused against me the winds and stopped my way, and made a wondrous sea

doom overcame thee of death that lays men at their length? Was it a
slow disease, or did Artemis the archer slay thee with the visitation
of her gentle shafts? And tell me of my father and my son, that I left
behind me; doth my honour yet abide with them, or hath another already
taken it, while they say that I shall come home no more? And tell me of
my wedded wife, of her counsel and her purpose, doth she abide with her
son and keep all secure, or hath she already wedded the best of the
Achaeans?’ “Even so I spake, and anon my lady mother answered me: ‘Yea verily, she
abideth with steadfast spirit in thy halls; and wearily for her the
nights wane always and the days in shedding of tears. But the fair
honour that is thine no man hath yet taken; but Telemachus sits at
peace on his demesne, and feasts at equal banquets, whereof it is meet
that a judge partake, for all men bid him to their house. And thy
father abides there in the field, and goes not down to the town, nor
lies he on bedding or rugs or shining blankets, but all the winter he
sleeps, where sleep the thralls in the house, in the ashes by the fire,
and is clad in sorry raiment. But when the summer comes and the rich
harvest-tide, his beds of fallen leaves are strewn lowly all about the
knoll of his vineyard plot. There he lies sorrowing and nurses his
mighty grief, for long desire of thy return, and old age withal comes
heavy upon him. Yea and even so did I too perish and meet my doom. It
was not the archer goddess of the keen sight, who slew me in my halls
with the visitation of her gentle shafts, nor did any sickness come
upon me, such as chiefly with a sad wasting draws the spirit from the
limbs; nay, it was my sore longing for thee, and for thy counsels,
great Odysseus, and for thy loving-kindness, that reft me of sweet
life.’ “So spake she, and I mused in my heart and would fain have embraced the

our hearts with weariness and sorrow. But when the fair-tressed Dawn
had at last brought the full light of the third day, we set up the
masts and hoisted the white sails and sat us down, while the wind and
the helmsman guided the ships. And now I should have come to mine own
country all unhurt, but the wave and the stream of the sea and the
North Wind swept me from my course as I was doubling Malea, and drave
me wandering past Cythera. “Thence for nine whole days was I borne by ruinous winds over the
teeming deep; but on the tenth day we set foot on the land of the
lotus-eaters, who eat a flowery food. So we stepped ashore and drew
water, and straightway my company took their midday meal by the swift
ships. Now when we had tasted meat and drink I sent forth certain of my
company to go and make search what manner of men they were who here
live upon the earth by bread, and I chose out two of my fellows, and
sent a third with them as herald. Then straightway they went and mixed
with the men of the lotus-eaters, and so it was that the lotus-eaters
devised not death for our fellows, but gave them of the lotus to taste.
Now whosoever of them did eat the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus, had
no more wish to bring tidings nor to come back, but there he chose to
abide with the lotus-eating men, ever feeding on the lotus, and
forgetful of his homeward way. Therefore I led them back to the ships
weeping, and sore against their will, and dragged them beneath the
benches, and bound them in the hollow barques. But I commanded the rest
of my well-loved company to make speed and go on board the swift ships,

we sat the livelong day till the going down of the sun, feasting on
abundant flesh and sweet wine. But when the sun sank and darkness came
on, they laid them to rest throughout the shadowy halls. “But when I had gone up into the fair bed of Circe, I besought her by
her knees, and the goddess heard my speech, and uttering my voice I
spake to her winged words: ‘Circe, fulfil for me the promise which thou
madest me to send me on my homeward way. Now is my spirit eager to be
gone, and the spirit of my company, that wear away my heart as they
mourn around me, when haply thou art gone from us.’ “So spake I, and the fair goddess answered me anon: ‘Son of Laertes, of
the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, tarry ye now no longer in
my house against your will; but first must ye perform another journey,
and reach the dwelling of Hades and of dread Persephone to seek to the
spirit of Theban Teiresias, the blind soothsayer, whose wits abide
steadfast. To him Persephone hath given judgment, even in death, that
he alone should have understanding; but the other souls sweep
shadow-like around.’ “Thus spake she, but as for me, my heart was broken, and I wept as I
sat upon the bed, and my soul had no more care to live and to see the
sunlight. But when I had my fill of weeping and grovelling, then at the
last I answered and spake unto her saying: ‘And who, Circe, will guide
us on this way? for no man ever yet sailed to hell in a black ship.’ “So spake I, and the fair goddess answered me anon: ‘Son of Laertes, of
the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, nay, trouble not thyself
for want of a guide, by thy ship abiding, but set up the mast and
spread abroad the white sails and sit thee down; and the breeze of the

ships where they stood in the sand, and my heart was darkly troubled as
I went. But after I had come down to the ship and to the sea, and we
had made ready our supper and immortal night had come on, then did we
lay us to rest upon the sea-beach. So soon as early Dawn shone forth,
the rosy fingered, in that hour I walked by the shore of the wide-wayed
sea, praying instantly to the gods; and I took with me three of my
company, in whom I trusted most for every enterprise. “Meanwhile, so it was that she had plunged into the broad bosom of the
sea, and had brought from the deep the skins of four sea-calves, and
all were newly flayed, for she was minded to lay a snare for her
father. She scooped lairs on the sea-sand, and sat awaiting us, and we
drew very nigh her, and she made us all lie down in order, and cast a
skin over each. There would our ambush have been most terrible, for the
deadly stench of the sea bred seals distressed us sore: nay, who would
lay him down by a beast of the sea? But herself she wrought
deliverance, and devised a great comfort. She took ambrosia of a very
sweet savour, and set it beneath each man’s nostril, and did away with
the stench of the beast. So all the morning we waited with steadfast

part of people she had never met; being laid out like a mist
between the people she knew best, who lifted her on their branches
as she had seen the trees lift the mist, but it spread ever so far,
her life, herself. But what was she dreaming as she looked into
Hatchards' shop window? What was she trying to recover? What
image of white dawn in the country, as she read in the book spread
open: Fear no more the heat o' the sun Nor the furious winter's rages. This late age of the world's experience had bred in them all, all
men and women, a well of tears. Tears and sorrows; courage and
endurance; a perfectly upright and stoical bearing. Think, for
example, of the woman she admired most, Lady Bexborough, opening
the bazaar. There were Jorrocks' Jaunts and Jollities; there were Soapy Sponge
and Mrs. Asquith's Memoirs and Big Game Shooting in Nigeria, all
spread open. Ever so many books there were; but none that seemed
exactly right to take to Evelyn Whitbread in her nursing home.
Nothing that would serve to amuse her and make that indescribably
dried-up little woman look, as Clarissa came in, just for a moment
cordial; before they settled down for the usual interminable talk
of women's ailments. How much she wanted it--that people should
look pleased as she came in, Clarissa thought and turned and walked
back towards Bond Street, annoyed, because it was silly to have
other reasons for doing things."," But now
that thou hast told all the sure tokens of our bed, which never was
seen by mortal man, save by thee and me and one maiden only, the
daughter of Actor, that my father gave me ere yet I had come hither,
she who kept the doors of our strong bridal chamber, even now dost thou
bend my soul, all ungentle as it is.” Thus she spake, and in his heart she stirred yet a greater longing to
lament, and he wept as he embraced his beloved wife and true. And even
as when the sight of land is welcome to swimmers, whose well-wrought
ship Poseidon hath smitten on the deep, all driven with the wind and
swelling waves, and but a remnant hath escaped the grey sea-water and
swum to the shore, and their bodies are all crusted with the brine, and
gladly have they set foot on land and escaped an evil end; so welcome
to her was the sight of her lord, and her white arms she would never
quite let go from his neck. And now would the rosy-fingered Dawn have
risen upon their weeping, but the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had other
thoughts. The night she held long in the utmost West, and on the other
side she stayed the golden-throned Dawn by the stream Oceanus, and
suffered her not to harness the swift-footed steeds that bear light to
men, Lampus and Phaethon, the steeds ever young, that bring the
morning. Then at the last, Odysseus of many counsels spake to his wife, saying:
“Lady, we have not yet come to the issue of all our labours; but still
there will be toil unmeasured, long and difficult, that I must needs
bring to a full end. Even so the spirit of Teiresias foretold to me, on
that day when I went down into the house of Hades, to inquire after a

honour that is thine no man hath yet taken; but Telemachus sits at
peace on his demesne, and feasts at equal banquets, whereof it is meet

father abides there in the field, and goes not down to the town, nor
lies he on bedding or rugs or shining blankets, but all the winter he
sleeps, where sleep the thralls in the house, in the ashes by the fire,

harvest-tide, his beds of fallen leaves are strewn lowly all about the
knoll of his vineyard plot. There he lies sorrowing and nurses his
mighty grief, for long desire of thy return, and old age withal comes
heavy upon him. Yea and even so did I too perish and meet my doom. It
was not the archer goddess of the keen sight, who slew me in my halls

were the crowning evil! But the wooers devise another far greater and
more grievous, which I pray the son of Cronos may never fulfil! They
are set on slaying Telemachus with the edge of the sword on his

the sea, and that cross the great wet waste. Is it that even his own

set him on or whether his own spirit stirred him to go to Pylos to seek

cloud of consuming grief; so that she might no more endure to seat her
on a chair, whereof there were many in the house, but there she
crouched on the threshold of her well-builded chamber, wailing
piteously, and her handmaids round her made low moan, as many as were

pray thee wilt thou speak of these? Thou needest not, for even I myself
will mark them well and take knowledge of each. Nay, do thou keep thy
saying to thyself, and leave the rest to the gods.” Even so he spake, and the old woman passed forth from the hall to bring
water for his feet, for that first water was all spilled. So when she
had washed him and anointed him well with olive-oil, Odysseus again
drew up his settle nearer to the fire to warm himself, and covered up
the scar with his rags. Then the wise Penelope spake first, saying: “Stranger, there is yet a little thing I will make bold to ask thee,

of Pandareus, the nightingale of the greenwood, sings sweet in the
first season of the spring, from her place in the thick leafage of the
trees, and with many a turn and trill she pours forth her full-voiced

high-roofed home, having respect unto the bed of my lord and the voice
of the people, or even now follow with the best of the Achaeans that
woos me in the halls, and gives a bride-price beyond reckoning? Now my
son, so long as he was a child and light of heart, suffered me not to
marry and leave the house of my husband; but now that he is great of
growth, and is come to the full measure of manhood, lo now he prays me
to go back home from these walls, being vexed for his possessions that
the Achaeans devour before his eyes. But come now, hear a dream of mine

came to the fair-lying palace, they laid aside their mantles on the
chairs and high seats, and went to the polished baths, and bathed them.
So when the maidens had bathed them and anointed them with olive oil,
and cast about them thick mantles and doublets, they came forth from
the baths, and sat upon the seats. Then the handmaid bare water for the
hands in a goodly golden ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin
to wash withal, and drew to their side a polished table. And the grave
dame bare wheaten bread, and set it by them, and laid on the board many
dainties, giving freely of such things as she had by her. And the
mother of Telemachus sat over against him by the pillar of the hall,
leaning against a chair, and spinning the slender threads from the
yarn. And they stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer set
before them. Now when they had put from them the desire of meat and

had now come to the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the well-builded
roof, holding her glistening tire before her face, and on either side
of her stood a faithful handmaid. And straightway the knees of the
wooers were loosened, and their hearts were enchanted with love, and
each one uttered a prayer that he might be her bed-fellow. But she
spake to Telemachus, her dear son: “Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer stable as they
were. While thou wast still a child, thou hadst a yet quicker and more
crafty wit, but now that thou art great of growth, and art come to the
measure of manhood, and a stranger looking to thy stature and thy
beauty might say that thou must be some rich man’s son, thy mind and
thy thoughts are no longer right as of old. For lo, what manner of deed
has been done in these halls, in that thou hast suffered thy guest to
be thus shamefully dealt with. How would it be now, if the stranger
sitting thus in our house, were to come to some harm all through this
evil handling? Shame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.” Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mother mine, as to this matter I
count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have I knowledge and
understanding of each thing, of the good and of the evil; but
heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I cannot devise all things according
to wisdom, for these men in their evil counsel drive me from my wits,
on this side and on that, and there is none to aid me. Howsoever this
battle between Irus and the stranger did not fall out as the wooers
would have had it, but the stranger proved the better man.",BOOK XVIII.,0.715008294557228,True,medium,"Both passages explore themes of identity, societal roles, and personal reflection.

was left behind in the hall, devising with Athene’s aid the slaying of
the wooers. Now forth from her chamber came the wise Penelope, like Artemis or
golden Aphrodite, and they set a chair for her hard by before the fire,
where she was wont to sit, a chair well-wrought and inlaid with ivory
and silver, which on a time the craftsman Icmalius had fashioned, and
had joined thereto a footstool, that was part of the chair, whereon a
great fleece was used to be laid. Here then, the wise Penelope sat her
down, and next came white-armed handmaids from the women’s chamber, and
began to take away the many fragments of food, and the tables and the
cups whence the proud lords had been drinking, and they raked out the
fire from the braziers on to the floor, and piled many fresh logs upon
them, to give light and warmth. Then Melantho began to revile Odysseus yet a second time, saying:
“Stranger, wilt thou still be a plague to us here, circling round the
house in the night, and spying the women? Nay, get thee forth, thou
wretched thing, and be thankful for thy supper, or straightway shalt
thou even be smitten with a torch and so fare out of the doors.” Then Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on her, and said: “Good
woman, what possesses thee to assail me thus out of an angry heart? Is
it because I go filthy and am clothed about in sorry raiment, and beg
through the land, for necessity is laid on me? This is the manner of
beggars and of wandering men. For I too once had a house of mine own
among men, a rich man with a wealthy house, and many a time would I
give to a wanderer, what manner of man soever he might be, and in
whatsoever need he came. And I had countless thralls, and all else in
plenty, whereby folk live well and have a name for riches. But Zeus,
the son of Cronos, made me desolate of all, for surely it was his will.
Wherefore, woman, see lest some day thou too lose all thy fine show
wherein thou now excellest among the handmaids, as well may chance, if
thy mistress be provoked to anger with thee, or if Odysseus come home,
for there is yet a place for hope. And even if he hath perished as ye
deem, and is never more to return, yet by Apollo’s grace he hath a son
like him, Telemachus, and none of the women works wantonness in his
halls without his knowledge, for he is no longer of an age not to mark
it, Thus he spake, and the wise Penelope heard him, and rebuked the
handmaid, and spake and hailed her: “Thou reckless thing and unabashed, be sure thy great sin is not hidden
from me, and thy blood shall be on thine own head for the same! Four
thou knewest right well, in that thou hadst heard it from my lips, how

been, like Lady Bexborough, slow and stately; rather large;
interested in politics like a man; with a country house; very
dignified, very sincere. Instead of which she had a narrow pea-

she held herself well was true; and had nice hands and feet; and
dressed well, considering that she spent little. But often now

in me, as well might be, were he to lie without a winding-sheet, a man
that had gotten great possessions.’ “So spake she, and our high hearts consented thereto. So then in the
day time she would weave the mighty web, and in the night unravel the
same, when she had let place the torches by her. Thus for the space of
three years she hid the thing by craft and beguiled the minds of the
Achaeans; but when the fourth year arrived and the seasons came round,
then at the last one of her women who knew all declared it, and we
found her unravelling the splendid web. Thus she finished it perforce
and sore against her will. But as for thee, the wooers make thee answer
thus, that thou mayest know it in thine own heart, thou and all the
Achaeans! Send away thy mother, and bid her be married to whomsoever
her father commands, and whoso is well pleasing unto her. But if she
will continue for long to vex the sons of the Achaeans, pondering in
her heart those things that Athene hath given her beyond women,
knowledge of all fair handiwork, yea, and cunning wit, and wiles—so be
it! Such wiles as hers we have never yet heard that any even of the
women of old did know, of those that aforetime were fair-tressed
Achaean ladies, Tyro, and Alcmene, and Mycene with the bright crown.
Not one of these in the imaginations of their hearts was like unto
Penelope, yet herein at least her imagining was not good. For in
despite of her the wooers will devour thy living and thy substance, so
long as she is steadfast in such purpose as the gods now put within her
breast: great renown for herself she winneth, but for thee regret for
thy much livelihood. But we will neither go to our own lands, nor
otherwhere, till she marry that man whom she will of the Achaeans.",BOOK II.,0.712203939928419,True,medium,"Both passages explore themes of identity, societal roles, and the expectations placed upon women.

thee, how wise soever, to observe the purposes of the everlasting gods.
None the less let us go to my child, that I may see the wooers dead,
and him that slew them.” With that word she went down from the upper chamber, and much her heart
debated, whether she should stand apart, and question her dear lord or
draw nigh, and clasp and kiss his head and hands. But when she had come
within and had crossed the threshold of stone, she sat down over
against Odysseus, in the light of the fire, by the further wall. Now he
was sitting by the tall pillar, looking down and waiting to know if
perchance his noble wife would speak to him, when her eyes beheld him.
But she sat long in silence, and amazement came upon her soul, and now
she would look upon him steadfastly with her eyes, and now again she
knew him not, for that he was clad in vile raiment. And Telemachus
rebuked her, and spake and hailed her: “Mother mine, ill mother, of an ungentle heart, why turnest thou thus
away from my father, and dost not sit by him and question him and ask
him all? No other woman in the world would harden her heart to stand
thus aloof from her lord, who after much travail and sore had come to
her in the twentieth year to his own country. But thy heart is ever
harder than stone.” Then wise Penelope answered him, saying: “Child, my mind is amazed
within me, and I have no strength to speak, nor to ask him aught, nay
nor to look on him face to face. But if in truth this be Odysseus, and
he hath indeed come home, verily we shall be ware of each other the
more surely, for we have tokens that we twain know, even we, secret
from all others.",BOOK XXIII.,0.7116091095186302,True,medium,"Both passages explore themes of identity and recognition, with Clarissa Dalloway reflecting on her public persona and Penelope grappling with the recognition of Odysseus.

For even if they are minded to wait the throned Dawn, they shall not
outstay me, so long enduring am I.” So he spake, but they laughed and looked one at the other. And the fair
Melantho chid him shamefully, Melantho that Dolius begat, but Penelope
reared, and entreated her tenderly as she had been her own child, and
gave her playthings to her heart’s desire. Yet, for all that, sorrow
for Penelope touched not her heart, but she loved Eurymachus and was
his paramour. Now she chid Odysseus with railing words: “Wretched guest, surely thou art some brain-struck man, seeing that
thou dost not choose to go and sleep at a smithy, or at some place of
common resort, but here thou pratest much and boldly among many lords
and hast no fear at heart. Verily wine has got about thy wits, or
perchance thou art always of this mind, and so thou dost babble idly.
Art thou beside thyself for joy, because thou hast beaten the beggar
Irus? Take heed lest a better man than Irus rise up presently against
thee, to lay his mighty hands about thy head and bedabble thee with
blood, and send thee hence from the house.” Then Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on her, and said: “Yea,
straight will I go yonder and tell Telemachus hereof, thou shameless
thing, for this thy speech, that forthwith he may cut thee limb from
limb.” So he spake, and with his saying scared away the women, who fled
through the hall, and the knees of each were loosened for fear, for
they deemed that his words were true. But Odysseus took his stand by
the burning braziers, tending the lights, and gazed on all the men: but
far other matters he pondered in his heart, things not to be
unfulfilled.",BOOK XVIII.,0.706904532365562,True,medium,"Both passages explore themes of identity and societal perception, with Clarissa Dalloway reflecting on her public persona and Odysseus confronting societal expectations in disguise.
